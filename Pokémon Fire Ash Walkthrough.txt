-----------
PALLET TOWN
-----------
Take out a Potion from your computer.
Go down stairs.
Mom will automatically give you Running Shoes.
From now on, your Mom will heal your party when you talk to her.
Leave the house.

Talk to Gary who blocks the way to Oak's Lab.
Go up stairs and grab a Potion in upper left part of the ledge.
Enter Oak's Lab.

Machine in Oak's Lab will heal your party.
Go to 2nd floor.
Take Pokeball with Pikachu.
Take Pokedex.

Leave Pallet Town to the west.

-------
ROUTE 1
-------
Wild Pokemon (* before name means that this is your first chance to get that Pokemon. I will only put them next to the unevolved Pokemon): *Pidgey, *Spearow, *Rattata, *Poliwag, *Sandshrew, *Mankey. Usual level 2-5. Ho-oh also appears here, but the chance is low (1%) AND it has level 50. You should wait to grow stronger before attempting to catch it, but it's technically possible even now.

Talk to the second person you see to get a Super Potion.

There is a Rare Candy hidden in a bush on the right side of the route.

Go north to Viridian City.
Item behind Gym can't be obtained at this time.

-------------
VIRIDIAN CITY
-------------

Go to the west, then north to get a Pokeball.

Team Rocket is in the Pokemon Center. You must defeat them to unlock the north exit from the city.

Pokemon Mart sells:
Poke Ball - 200
Potion - 300

The path west (Route 22) is blocked until you get 8 badges, so go north.

-------
ROUTE 2
-------

Follow the road and enter Viridian Forest.

---------------
VIRIDIAN FOREST
---------------
Wild Pokemon: *Caterpie, *Weedle, Kakuna, Beedrill, Pidgey, Pidgeotto, Spearow, rarely Fearow. Usual level 3-5.
4 Trainers.
Items:
Antidote: In tall grass in SW part of the forest.
Pokeball: Hidden in NW corner of the glade when you enter the forest. It should be mentioned that the way to pick these is a bit counterintuitive. You must step NEXT to the target tile, turned toward the target tile, and search with action button. Makes sense when target tile is impassable, but not really when it's just empty space.
Antidote: In tall grass in SE part of the forest.
Potion: In the NW part of the forest.

Exit north.

-------
ROUTE 2
-------

Continue north.

-----------
PEWTER CITY
-----------
Immediately go around the trees on your right and back south to Route 2 to grab TM54 (False Swipe). Go back north to Pewter City.

Go to NW corner. A Pokeball is hidden on 2nd tile from the top.

Gym: 1 trainer and Brock. Defeating Brock will get you Boulder Badge and TM80 (Rock Slide).

After beating Brock, go to his house (NW part of the town). Talk to the person in top left corner to obtain TM37 (Sandstorm).
!!! If you forget to get the TM37 now, you can still get it later -- but once the Unova part of the game starts, the guy gets a new dialogue and you'll lose your chance!

You now have 1 badge, which means that Pokemarts expand their inventory. Their inventory now is:
Poke Ball - 200
Great Ball - 600
Potion - 300
Super Potion - 700
Antidote - 100
Parlyz Heal - 200
Awakening - 250
Burn Heal - 250
Ice Heal - 250
Escape Rope - 550
Repel - 350

Beating Brock also unlocks Pewter City as a destination for the teleporters in Pokemon Centers.

Leave to the east.

-------
ROUTE 3
-------
Wild Pokemon: Pidgey, Spearow, *Jigglypuff, *NidoranM, *NidoranF, Mankey, rarely *Ekans. Level 3-8.
This is your first chance to obtain Ekans, however the encounter rate is only 1%. There will be better chances later if you don't want to spend lot of time searching for it.
8 Trainers.
Items:
Oran Berry: In second patch of tall grass, around the middle of the route.
Repel: Hidden in a boulder on top of a small plateau with stairs leading to it.

Guy close to the end of the route sells Repels.

Enter the cave to Mt Moon.

-------
MT MOON
-------
Wild Pokemon: *Zubat, *Clefairy, Clefable and *Paras appear in both floors. *Geodude appears only on the upper floor, while Sandshrew only appears on the lower floor. Usual level is 5-10.

Start by going to the left to fight a trainer and grab a Nugget. Then take the ladder down; you'll get to an enclosed chamber with a trainer and two items: Antidote on the left and Revive on the right.

On the upper floor, go north and east from the ladder. The correct route is north and west, but explore the SE part of the floor for some goodies: there are 2 trainers in this section (one on the left, one on the right) and 2 items: Visible TM46 (Thief) on the left and hidden Ether; there is a formation of 3 rocks in the very SE corner of the floor, the Ether is in the middle rock.

Going along the correct route, you will find another trainer and then a room with ladder. There is a Revive in the SW corner of this room. Take the ladder.

From where you appear on the lower floor, go north. There are three rocks in the northern part of this room; the one on the right hides Moon Stone.

There's a trainer, and after him you'll come to two sets of stairs. The stairs on the left lead to a guy who gives you TM08 (Bulk Up). There is an Escape Rope north of him. The stairs on the right lead you around the floor, past 3 other trainers, to the ladder up. Before you take it, there is another Ether, hidden in an empty spot in the middle of the NW rock formation.

Once you take the ladder, go west and exit the cave.

-------
ROUTE 4
-------

Nothing to do here now. Exit east.

-------------
CERULEAN CITY
-------------

Talk to the purple-haired girl to obtain Eviolite.

Go to the NW house and leave through the back door. There's Rare Candy hidden in the garden behind the house; it's in the top row, on the left empty tile between two blue flowers.

The house next to the Pokemon Center has an old man who will trade you Tangela for your Rattata.

The house north of the Gym has a guy who will give you TM27 (Return).

The Gym has 2 trainers plus Misty. Defeating Misty gets you Cascade Badge and TM55 (Scald)

After beating Misty, Cerulean City will be add to the list of teleport destinations.

Go south (you will have to take the long way around because there's a tree in your way).

-------
ROUTE 5
-------
Wild Pokemon: Pidgey, *Meowth, *Oddish. Level 10-16.

Route 5 can be entered from left, right or center. Tall grass with wild Pokemon is only on the middle route. There's also one trainer. At the south end of this part is the Day Care center to raise and breed your Pokemon. The important thing to note is that in order to pick up Pokemon you leave there or an egg (the old man outside will give you an egg, when one is generated) you must have empty spot in your party. There is a PC in the Day Care, but it's not usable.

This is your first chance to obtain Cleffa, Igglybuff or Pichu, by breeding Clefairy, Jigglypuff, or Pikachu, respectively. Female Clefairy and Jigglypuff can be caught in Mt Moon or on Route 3, respectively, if you only have male ones, but you only have one Pikachu at this point and if it's a guy, you won't be able to obtain Pichu until you get a Ditto.
That being said, you can get your Pichu to be born with Volt Tackle if the Pikachu is holding a Light Ball, which you will get later, so I'd suggest to wait a bit in any case.

On the west side of the route, there is a gap in the fence. Go through it, then south and east along the fence to obtain Revive at the end of the path.

The gatehouse is impassable for now, so go through the trees beyond the gap in the fence to enter Hidden Village.

--------------
HIDDEN VILLAGE
--------------
Wild Pokemon: Rattata, Paras, Oddish, Weepinbell, Caterpie, *Staryu, *Magikarp. Usual level 10-15.
Technically, this is your first chance to get a Weepinbell, but you might prefer to catch a Bellsprout a bit further.

Hidden Village is one long winding path and you'll have to go through tall grass, so be prepared. There is only one visible item (Big Root) which is around the middle of the path -- you can't really miss it. However, there are also 4 hidden items:

1: After first patch of tall grass, you see two red flowers in opposite vertices of 3x5 rectangle. Sitrus Berry is hidden in the center of this rectangle.

2: Second patch of tall grass is out of the way and you don't have to go through it. You DO have to go through the third patch. North of this patch are two red flowers. Three tiles west and one tile north from the top flower is Leppa Berry.

3: The fourth patch of tall grass is the largest one and it covers most of the bottom part of the path. Hug the northern edge of the path. You'll go through two tall grass tiles, and then there are three empty tiles. Lum Berry is hidden on the left empty tile.

4: After leaving the fourth patch, you'll enter the final area of Hidden Village. From the SW red flower, Chesto Berry is two tiles east and three tiles north.

At the end of the village is a guy and Bulbasaur. SAVE YOUR GAME! If you talk to Bulbasaur, you get a chance to fight it. It's on level 12 and it's the only wild Bulbasaur in the game, so you must catch it if you want your own.

After getting Bulbasaur, go east into the trees.

--------
ROUTE 24
--------
Weather forecast: Sometimes rainy

Wild Pokemon: Pidgey, Caterpie, Oddish, *Venonat, Weedle, Metapod, Kakuna, *Abra, *Bellsprout, Pidgeotto. Usual level 7-14.

8 trainers.

Enter the Pokemon Center and talk to the guy on the right. He'll tell you he ditched his Charmander. Well, one man's trash...

Leave the Pokemon Center and go east. There's Charmander on the rock. If you talked to his former trainer, you can take him (unlike Bulbasaur, you don't fight Charmander, you just take it). Once you have him, return to the Pokemon Center and talk to the guy on the left to obtain Charcoal.

Note: You should try to train up Charmander and evolve it into Charizard. To obtain a certain TM later, you will need a Charizard.

Go south.

--------
ROUTE 25
--------

Route 25 has several parts. We can't enter the southern part right now so we can't fight wild Pokemon. You'll have to resolve the Squirtle problem first.

Enter the top left house to encounter Team Rocket once again. After defeating them, talk to Squirtle and take him with you. Unlike Charmander, who can be skipped, you HAVE to take Squirtle, otherwise you won't be able to progress.

Once you have Squirtle, talk to the cop outside to get Blackglasses. You can now pass to the southern part of the route.

Wild Pokemon: Pidgey, Meowth, Oddish, Bellsprout. Usual level 10-15.

There are 6 trainers in this part, including a pair of double trainers. Double trainers can be actually fought twice, by talking to one of them and then the other.

In the very NW corner of this part, you can find a hidden Ether.

After you pass the part with tall grass, you'll see the Lighthouse. Enter it and talk to the Pokemon inside. It's actually Bill. Agree to help him and he will reward you with Old Rod. Talk to Bill again and "Someone's PC" where you store your Pokemon will be renamed to "Bill's PC".

With the Old Rod, you can now start fishing. Unfortunately, all places where you've been so far only have Magikarp and Poliwag available with Old Rod. You can still grab them if you haven't got them yet.

However, Route 25 itself is special. Only Pokemon that appears in the water here is Krabby, even with Old Rod. The Krabbies range from level 15 to 22.

Catch a Krabby if you want and go south.

---------------
VERMILLION CITY
---------------

Go east where a sailor and his Machop are. In the middle of the plot of land is TM111 (Dazzling Gleam).

The orange-roofed house in the middle row (west of Pokemart) has a kid who will trade a Farfetch'd for your Spearow.

Next to this house is the Pokemon Fan Club. Talk to the old man and agree to listen to his blather about his Fearow to get a Bicycle.

Brock is in front of the gym and you must defeat him again to get him to leave.

Gym contains 3 trainers + Lt. Surge. In order to get to him, you must find two switches hidden in the trashcans. Both of them are in the top row: the one on the left end and the third one from the right. Defeating Lt. Surge nets you Thunder Badge and TM24 (Thunderbolt). It will also allow you to obtain Light Ball form the lady in Pokemon Fan Club. And, as always, it will allow you to teleport here through Pokemon Centers.

Another benefit of defeating Lt. Surge is that a small tree in Cerulean City will be finally cut, making travel between Cerulean City and Route 5 much easier.

The way east from the city is blocked by a sailor. To get past him, you must go on S.S. Anne cruise. S.S. Anne is at the right of the 3 docks in Vermillion City.

Note: Technically, you could skip Cerulean Gym and go directly to Vermillion City. However, if you did this, then this is where you'd have to go back -- you must beat BOTH Misty and Lt. Surge to be allowed on the ship.

Another note:
Once you do, in fact, defeat both and have 3 badges, Pokemart inventory updates again:
Poke Ball - 200
Great Ball - 600
Potion - 300
Super Potion - 700
Hyper Potion - 1200
Revive - 1500
Antidote - 100
Parlyz Heal - 200
Awakening - 250
Burn Heal - 250
Ice Heal - 250
Escape Rope - 550
Repel - 350
Super Repel - 500

---------
S.S. Anne
---------

This is a big ship with four floors. You start on 1F. 1F has a row of cabins. Your cabin is the second one from the right and it contains a bed where you can heal your party and a PC. The rest of ship is basically lots and lots of trainers.

Cabins on 1F, from left to right:

First cabin: Trainer.
Second cabin: Trainer.
Third cabin: Just a guy to talk to.
Fourth cabin: Trainer.
Fifth cabin: Just people.
Sixth cabin: Just a biker.
Seventh cabin: Your cabin.
Eighth cabin: Trainer.

Apart from cabins, there's a fisherman who offers you a super-rare Pokemon (actually a level 15 Magikarp). If you go left and down, you get to the kitchen. There are three trash cans on the right side of the room, and each of them hides an item. From top to bottom: Pecha Berry, Cheri Berry, Chesto Berry.

2F, accessible through the stairs in upper-left corner of 1F, has five more rooms. All of them, except for the leftmost one, have a trainer to fight (the second room from the left and the rightmost room have two). The rightmost room also contains TM44 (Rest).

The stairs at lower left corner lead to the deck. There is another trainer there (the Gentleman on the left). After you beat him, he offers to trade his Raticate for your Butterfree, and you can actually talk to him again after that and trade them back.

The last floor is B1F which is accessed through stairs in the bottom-right corner of 1F. First of all, grab Hyper Potion that is hidden in the trash can next to the stairs. Then start checking the rooms.
This floor has five rooms. First four rooms from the right (where you enter the floor) contain one normal trainer each. However, the fifth, leftmost room contains Team Rocket! And you get into a fight the moment you enter the door! Surprise!

When you beat Team Rocket, the sinister plan is put into motion. Various sailors you've seen sanding in the corridors suddenly change into Team Rocket members who will fight you. You can skip them all and get directly to the final boss of the ship by stepping on the blue tile in the room you fought Team Rocket in, but where's the fun in that?

There are:
3 Team Rocket Members on B1F (and you'll have to beat all of them to get back to the stairs).
4 members on 1F.
5 members on 2F.
2 members on the deck.

In addition, the sailor who blocked the way to the stairs in top-right corner of 2F is now gone, letting you enter the captain's cabin (which is also where you end up if you take the blue tile in Team Rocket room). However, once you go to captain's cabin, you can't leave until you fight the boss, so do everything else you want first!

There's two Team Rocket members in the captain's cabin, but one of them is just there to block the stairs. The other one, on the top of the room, is the one you have fight. Once you defeat him, he disappears. Talk to the captain and you'll end up back in Vermillion City. The sailor on the eastern side will now let you pass.

--------
ROUTE 11
--------
Wild Pokemon: Sandshrew, *Drowzee, Spearow, Ekans. Level 15-18.
You could have caught an Ekans before, on Route 3, but Route 11 has much better chances to find them.

There are 3 trainers here to fight. TM09 (Venoshock) is available in plain sight, but there's one more item: The boulder next to the house at the northern end contains an Escape Rope.

On the eastern side of this Route, there's Butterfree mating season. Five people watch them.

Second one from top lets you release a Butterfree if you have one.
Fourth one will give you a free Great Ball.
Fifth one is a trainer to fight.

When you're done here, enter the house and go through the Underground Path. It's entirely uneventful, so I'm not even going to give it its own section.

-------
ROUTE 8
-------
Wild Pokemon: Pidgey, Meowth, Sandshrew, Ekans, *Vulpix, *Growlithe

All tall grass is in a fairly small fenced area in the middle of the Route. This patch has one visible item, TM20 (Safeguard), along the south edge, and three hidden items:

1: Rawst Berry -- two tiles west and three tiles north from the TM20.
2: Lum Berry -- one row above Rawst Berry, three tiles west from the eastern fence.
3: Lepa Berry -- in the same column as Rawst Berry, three tiles south from the northern fence.

There are 13 trainers on this route, including a pair of Double Trainers (who, like before, can be fought twice).

Route 8 connects Lavender Town (east) and Saffron City (west). you have to go through a gate house to get to Saffron City, but the guard will let you go through, unlike the one at Route 5.

Go to Saffron City.

------------
SAFFRON CITY
------------

This is the biggest town we have found yet! Let's have a look around!

Interesting places:
House in NW corner: On the upper floor, you'll find a girl who can teach Role Play to Pokemon.
House in SE corner: Talk to the man here to get TM29 (Psychic).
Silph Co. (the tall building in center of the city): Talk to the receptionist to get TM90 (Substitute).

The Gym contains 9 rooms in 3x3 grid. Let's number them from 1 to 9 so the NW room is 1, north room is 2, west room is 4, etc.

Each room contains a trainer except for room 8 (which is the entrance). Sabrina is in the central room (room 5). All other rooms contain 4 teleporters, which are placed roughly in the corners. Teleporters are connected in pairs (stepping on a teleporter always moves you to the paired teleporter).

Room 1 (NW) - NW -> 3/SW ; NE -> 2/NE ; SW -> 5/E ; SE -> 4/SW
Room 2 (north) - NW -> 6/SW ; NE -> 1/NE ; SW -> 4/NE ; SE -> 7/SW
Room 3 (NE) - NW -> 6/NW; NE -> 9/NW; SW -> 1/NW; SE -> 7/NW
Room 4 (west) - NW -> 6/SE ; NE -> 2/SW ; SW -> 1/SE ; SE -> 7/SE
Room 5 (center, Sabrina) - W -> 8 (one-way); E -> 1/SW
Room 6 (east) - NW -> 3/NW ; NE -> 9/NE ; SW -> 2/NW ; SE -> 4/NW
Room 7 (SW) - NW -> 3/SE ; NE -> 9/SW ; SW -> 2/SE ; SE -> 4/SE
Room 8 (south, entrance) - only contains one teleported, connected to SE teleporter in Room 9.
Room 9 (SE) - NW -> 3/NE; NE -> 6/NE; SW -> 7/NE; SE -> 8

So room 9 can be reached with a single teleport, rooms 3, 6, and 7 with two, rooms 1, 2, and 4 with three and central room 5 requires 4 teleports.

Unfortunately, when you defeat Sabrina, she won't give you the badge -- instead she gives you a new quest: beat Pokemon Tower in Lavender Town. Go through Route 8 to get there.

-------------
LAVENDER TOWN
-------------

If you went here before, you'd find that the entrance to Pokemon Tower is blocked by a person who warns you away. She'll be gone now.

Three houses can be entered. SE house contains Name Rater who can change the nicknames of your Pokemon.

Enter Pokemon Tower.

-------------
POKEMON TOWER
-------------

First two floors are safe. Only from 3rd floor up you'll start to encounter wild Pokemon.

Wild Pokemon (3F-6F): *Gastly, Haunter, Gengar. Level 25 or 28.

3F: 3 trainers and Escape Rope.

4F: 3 trainers and 4 items, all visible:
Awakening: Near the center of the floor.
Great Ball: In dead end, close to Awakening.
HP Up: In south part of the floor.
Elixir: Near the stairs to 5F.

5F: 3 trainers and 3 items:
Nugget: In south part of the floor.
Cleanse Tag: Near the center.
Heart Scale: Go to the north end of the floor and then to the west. Heart Scale is hidden on the last tile in the dead end.

There is a mystical diagram in the center of the floor. When you enter its center, it will heal your party.

6F: 3 trainers and 2 items:
X Accuracy: In the eastern part of the floor.
Rare Candy: In the SW part of the floor.

7F: No random encounters, just the boss, Karina. Once you defeat her, she will give you TM121 (Shadow Punch).

Now you can go back to Saffron City.

------------
SAFFRON CITY
------------

Go to the Gym and defeat Sabrina again. You'll get Marsh Badge and TM04 (Calm Mind). This will also add both Saffron City and Lavender Town to the Pokemon Center teleport destinations.

In addition, the gates from Saffron City can now be passed. Route 5 lies to the north and Route 24 to the south. West is Route 7 -- new destination.

-------
ROUTE 7
-------
Wild Pokemon: Mankey, Primeape, Vulpix, Meowth, Pidgey, Oddish, Bellsprout, Growlithe. Level 25-27.

Misty appears at the start of this route and you have to defeat her again. Otherwise, there's nothing here. Continue west to Celadon City.

------------
CELADON CITY
------------

Gary blocks the door to Pokemon Center. Talk to him to get him to leave.

In the top row of houses, there is a lone tree between two houses. You can find a PP Up in there.

In the SE area, a guy will give you TM21 (Frustration). You can also find an Ether if you follow the fence west.

In the row of 5 houses, go to the second one from the left. Talk to the man in top right corner to receive the Coin Case.

In the game corner, there is an attendant that will let you buy coins.

Next to the Game Corner, you can exchange your coins for prizes. The attendant on the left will let you exchange coins for items:

Smoke Ball - 800 coins
Miracle Seed - 1000 coins
Charcoal - 1000 coins
Mystic Water - 1000 coins
Yellow Flute - 1600 coins.

The attendant on the right will let you exchange coins for Pokemon:
Abra - 180 coins
Clefairy - 500 coins
*Dratini - 2800 coins
*Scyther - 5500 coins
*Porygon - 9999 coins

Note that both Dratini and Scyther can be found in Safari Zone which you'll reach quite soon. If you want to limit your coin grinding, you can just get a Porygon.

Coins can be won in slots or in the Voltorb Flip game. Voltorb Flip is better (doesn't cost anything to play so you can't lose), but to get better payouts, you must win multiple games in a row. http://www.voltorbflip.com/ has an application that solves the game for you, but since there can be multiple solutions, it can just lead you to make the LEAST risky moves, but not eliminate the risk entirely; thus, reaching high levels with high payouts is hard even with this -- especially since your game level can randomly drop when you lose. Also remember that if you stop playing, you'll have to start over from Lv. 1 next time.

The top and right part of the Game Corner is dedicated to Triple Triad (originally from Final Fantasy VIII). There are four card players on the right and the guy behind the desk lets you buy or sell cards. You can only buy cards for Pokemon you already own.

Person in top left deals with Lottery where you can win prizes if you have a Pokemon with original Trainer ID corresponding to the lucky number. You can win:

Ultra Ball for matching the last digit.
PP Up for matching the last 2 digits.
Exp. Share for matching the last 3 digits.
Max Revive for matching the last 4 digits.
Master Ball for matching all 5 digits.

In NW corner is a big building with two entrances -- Celadon Department Store. In the Department Store, there are two ways to travel between floors, through stairs or the elevator.

2F: Top cashier sells:
Potion - 300
Super Potion - 700
Hyper Potion - 1200
Max Potion - 2500
Full Restore - 3000
Revive - 1500
Antidote - 100
Parlyz Heal - 200
Burn Heal - 250
Ice Heal - 250
Awakening - 250
Full Heal - 600

Bottom cashier sells: 
Poke Ball - 200
Great Ball - 600
Ultra Ball - 1200
Escape Rope - 550
Repel - 350
Super Repel - 500
Max Repel - 700
Grass Mail - 50
Flame Mail - 50
Bubble Mail - 50

3F: The girl in the enclosed area will teach your Pokemon Sky Attack.

4F: The cashier here sells:
Poke Doll - 1000
Air Mail - 50
Tunnel Mail - 50
Bloom Mail - 50
Fire Stone - 2100
Thunderstone - 2100
Water Stone - 2100
Leaf Stone - 2100

This is an important one because the evolution stones are quite handy.

5F: Two cashiers here. The top one sells:
HP Up - 9800
Protein - 9800
Iron - 9800
Calcium - 9800
Zinc - 9800
Carbos - 9800

Bottom one sells:

X Defend - 550
X Speed - 350
X Special - 350
X Sp.Def - 350
X Accuracy - 950
Guard Spec - 700
Dire Hit - 650

Rooftop: Three vending machines are here, selling:
Fresh Water - 200
Soda Pop - 300
Lemonade - 350

Unlike a normal shop, you can only buy one at a time. There's a chance you'll get an extra drink for free, though.

Next to the Department Store is the P1 Grand Prix building. Brock is there, as well as 5 other normal trainers and Anthony, the boss. Beating Anthony will give you a Black Belt. You can also give him Pokemon to train, similar to Day Care. Actually, there are several people in the game who will train your Pokemon, but they all share the same ones. On one hand, it makes it easier to drop them off and pick them up, but on the other hand, only the guy at Day Care Center can give you eggs and that's probably the main reason why you use Day Care.

Gym: Grass type, has 7 trainers plus Erika. Defeating Erika gives you Rainbow Badge and TM53 (Energy Ball). Pokecenter teleport system adds Celadon City as a destination.

With 5 badges, Poke Marts update again:

Go west to Route 16.

--------
ROUTE 16
--------
Wild Pokemon: *Doduo, Rattata, Spearow, Raticate. Usual level 25-29.

Before tackling Cycling Road, let's visit the power plant in the north.

------------------------
GRINGEY CITY POWER PLANT
------------------------
Wild Pokemon: *Grimer, *Magnemite, Muk, Magneton. Level 27-31
Items:
Max Potion: North of the entry.
Thunderstone: In the SE corner.
TM17 (Protect): In the NE corner.

In the NW corner, there's a battle against L35 Muk.

Go back out.

--------
ROUTE 16
--------

Cycling Road can be entered through gate. However, before you do so, go upstairs in the gate building. A guy on the right will give you an Amulet Coin.
Note that while you need to have a bike to enter the Cycling Road, you are not required to ride it.

Full Restore can be found on the Cycling Road, hidden in the NW-most tile. Max Elixir can be found on the tile just S from the signpost.

Go south to Route 17. NOW you will automatically jump on a bike.

--------
ROUTE 17
--------
Wild Pokemon: Doduo, Rattata, Raticate, Spearow, Fearow. Usual level 25-29.

This is a long road with 6 trainers. There's a hidden item (Rare Candy) on a tile directly above the middle of the sandy stretch. PP Up is hidden in the SE corner of this sandy stretch. Finally, there's Max Revive -- at the southern end of the road, you'll see a short fence. Max Revive is hidden on the tile south of the middle section of the fence.

Continue south to Route 18.

--------
ROUTE 18
--------

Just a small stretch of a road. There's a woman in the upper floor of the gate building that will trade a Slowbro for her Lickitung.

The next gym is technically right here, on Route 18, but let's check Fuchsia City to the east first.

------------
FUCHSIA CITY
------------

The top of this town is a zoo with various Pokemon exhibits.

In NW part, in front of Kangaskhan exhibition is a guy who claims to teach Substitute, but in fact teaches Role Play. Probably a bug, as we already met the Role Play move tutor in Saffron City and we have the TM for Substitute.

The house east of the Pokemon Center contains Move Deleter who can remove moves from your Pokemon. Since this game has no HMs, there is not much point to it.

From the house in SE part of the town, you can go back to the yard. There's Max Revive hidden there, on the tile adjacent to all three flowers. But what's more important, there's water to fish! Even with just the Old Rod, you can catch a Slowpoke here.

Go north to Safari Zone.

-----------
SAFARI ZONE
-----------

At this point, you can only access the central (Kanto) part of the Safari Zone. Rules are: pay 500$ for right to make 600 steps in the Safari Zone, plus 30 Safari Balls to catch wild Pokemon.

Wild Pokemon in Kanto part: *Tauros, *Tangela, *Rhyhorn, Nidorina, Nidorino, *Exeggcute, Venonat, Parasect, Scyther, *Pinsir, *Chansey. Level 30-35.
If you didn't buy Scyther in Game Corner, this is first chance to catch it normally. Pinsir and Chansey have only 1% encounter rate. However, since encounters in Safari Zone are less tedious, it's not that hard to grind for them. Note that Exeggcute and Scyther are available on Route 19 just south of Fuchsia City, so that might be a better option for you.

Note: Definitely get a Tauros -- you will need one for a quest later in the game.

You can also fish here -- Old Rod gets you either *Horsea or Dratini, level 30-32. Dratini is another one of those Pokemon in Game Corner.

Two visible items: HP Up in SW corner and TM11 (Sunny Day) in NE corner. There's also a hidden Nugget: Go to the NE grass patch. It has 4 grass tiles adjacent to the lake. Nugget is hidden on the second one from the left.

Once you catch what you want, go to the Gym on Route 18.

The gym has 6 trainers plus Koga. It also has "invisible" walls -- but you can still spot them: wall tiles have pure white spots in the corners. Koga will give you Soul Badge plus TM06 (Toxic) for defeating him. This will also add Fuchsia City to the Pokemon Center teleports.

Now go south from Fuchsia City to Route 19.

--------
ROUTE 19
--------
Wild Pokemon: Venonat, *Lickitung, Butterfree, Exeggcute, Spearow, Abra, Scyther, Oddish, Exeggutor. Level 30-32. Exeggutor only has a 1% encounter rate.

There are 10 trainers on this Route.

There are 4 items here, all hidden:
Ultra Ball: NE from the first tall grass patch, in a corner.
Hyper Potion: On the right side of the fourth tall grass patch is empty space bordered by trees. To find a Hyper Potion, search the third tile from the right in the top row of this space.
Heart Scale: At the left side of the fourth tall grass patch is a row of 4 empty tiles between trees and tall grass. Heart Scale is hidden in the second tile from the right.
Rare Candy: Hidden in the very NW corner of Route, next to the second house.

There are two houses on this Route:

The right house contains another Team Rocket battle. Afterwards, you can talk to Misty and fight her for Togepi. You won't get it, sadly. Once you beat Misty, the house can be no longer entered.

The left house contains an old man. If you've beaten Koga and Misty, he will give you the Vermillion Ticket.

As the ticket name suggests, you should now go to Vermillion City.

---------------
VERMILLION CITY
---------------

Go to the docks. The middle pier will accept your Vermillion Ticket and you'll be able to go to the Cinnabar Island.

---------------
CINNABAR ISLAND
---------------
First of all, this is the first place where you can obtain Goldeen. It can be caught even with Old Rod, at level 15-19.

There are two important buildings on the island: Pokemon Institute and Pokemon Mansion.

Pokemon Institute has a Fossil Reviver who can revive fossil Pokemon for you. There's also a Move Tutor that teaches Seismic Toss.
On the left you'll find three traders. They will trade:

Your Raichu for their Electrode (left one)
Your Venonat for their Haunter (middle one)
Your Seel for their Ponyta (right one)

But you need to go to Pokemon Mansion -- only then you'll earn the right to go to the Cinnabar Gym.

---------------
POKEMON MANSION
---------------
Wild Pokemon: The mansion has 4 floors (1F, 2F, 3F, B1F). All floors contain *Koffing, Grimer, Rattata, Muk and Weezing. Floor 1F-3F has Raticate while Floor B1F has it replaced by Ditto. Additionally, each floor has a different Fire-type Pokemon: 1F has Growlithe, 2F has Vulpix, 3F has *Ponyta and B1F has *Magmar.

Thanks to half-destroyed state of the mansion, you can't just grab things on each floor in order. You have to take a roundabout route.

1F:
There are two trainers on this floor.
4 items:
Moon Stone: Hidden on the left side of the floow, in the small rock among a pile of rocks.
Escape Rope: Visible on a table in the top left room.
Carbos: Visible in top right quadrant of the floor.
Protein: In the big room with stairs down, it's hidden in the top left corner. Can't be obtained right now.

2F:
Two trainers as well.
3 items, all visible:
Calcium: In the room south from the stairs down.
Zinc: On a table in top right room.
HP Up: In the broken doorway near to right stairs up. Can't be obtained right now.

There are three stairs up on the floor. The lower stairs (the one next to stairs form 1F) lead to a separate area of 3F with an item (Iron) and a trainer. To get further, take the upper stairs.

3F:
Once again, two trainers.
4 items:
Iron: Visible on a table in the bottom left room.
Rare Candy: Hidden in a lone rock in top right corner.
Max Potion: Visible in bottom right part of the room.
Max Revive: Hidden on the tile right below Max Potion.

Note that Ponyta can be caught on this floor.
Iron is accessible from the first stairs, other 3 items are in the main area of the floor. Get to the down stairs on the right and go back to 2F.

2F:
Now you're in the right position to grab the HP Up. There's a hole in a wall to the south. Ignore what the trainer says and fall into it.

1F:
You can get Protein now. Go to B1F.

B1F:
One trainer. In the top left room, there's a guy you have to talk to in order to "complete" this dungeon. In the room below him is the only item on this floor, TM22 (Solar Beam).

Note that this floor has Ditto and Magmar. Especially Ditto is a Pokemon you should get because of its universal breeding compatibility. Since this floor is hard to access, you should catch what you want while you're still here.

Once you're done, go back up and out. There's an exit from the mansion south of the stairs.

With Ditto, you can now obtain some pre-evolutions (Pichu, Cleffa and Igglybuff) if you weren't able to before. You are now also able to breed Magmar to get Magby.

Note that while Chansey also has a pre-evolution, you can't get the necessary item yet.

But what's more important, the ship can now take you to the Cinnabar Gym!

------------
CINNABAR GYM
------------

There are 5 trainers in the Gym, plus Blaine.

Once you beat Blaine, he'll send you to hit a switch to calm down the volcano. Boulders that block your way to a ladder disappear.

Upstairs, you can find two more trainers, as well as the switch. With the switch pressed, you can fight Blaine again. This time, he'll give you the Volcano Badge, as well as TM35 (Flamethrower). Cinnabar Island will be now a possible destination in PokeCenter teleport system.

With 7 badges, Poke Marts update again:
Poke Ball - 200
Great Ball - 600
Ultra Ball - 1200

Max Repel - 700

Teleport to Viridian City.

BONUS: Catching Ho-Oh

Since our journey takes us back to Viridian City now, let's try getting our first legend, Ho-Oh!

Ho-Oh appears on Route 1 with 1% chance. It's at level 50. It's a normal encounter, so you can encounter it again even if you catch or defeat it.

To catch it in reasonable time, I'd suggest the following setup:

1. Buy some Max Repels and LOTS of Ultra Balls. Catch rate of Ho-Oh is very low.

Max Repels will be used to avoid encounters. The trick is that they only prevent encounters with Pokemon of lower level than the one in your first slot. If that Pokemon has a reasonable level, BUT not greater than 50, Max Repel will avoid all standard Pokemon on Route 1, so you can only encounter Ho-Oh. You might walk a long time before that happens, but it's considerably quicker than fighting normal battles or escaping them.

2. Your leading Pokemon should be a Beedrill. That's because Beedrill has the Swarm ability which doubles encounter rate -- leads to less wasted Repels.

3. You need some source of paralysis to improve catch rate. Pikachu's Nuzzle is a good one, since you definitely have a Pikachu and since Nuzzle always paralyses. While sleep would improve catch rate more than paralysis, paralysis has the advantage of never wearing off.

4. You need something strong to beat Ho-Oh down -- I'll leave details to you. False Swipe (TM54) on a high-level Pokemon would be nice since it can't KO.

5. Before trying to find Ho-Oh, SAVE THE GAME. Even when you find Ho-Oh, it might still take multiple attempts, and even an unsuccessful attempt will cost you lots of valuable Ultra Balls. If you encounter Ho-Oh and fail to catch it, reload and try again.

Once you find Ho-Oh, paralyze it, reduce its HP and start chucking Ultra Balls. Ho-Oh has Sunny Day and three damage-dealing moves: Fire Blast, Sacred Fire, and Punishment. Paralysis and the natural tendency of Pokemon Essentials to sometimes skip turn of wild Pokemon will reduce the number of turns it takes, but if you want to improve your longevity even further, you could use a Pokemon with Flash Fire ability (like Vulpix, Growlithe or Ponyta). These are completely immune to Fire Blast and Sacred Fire, leaving Punishment as the only attack that will work.

If you manage to get a Ho-Oh, congratulations! -- you got a powerful uber-legendary and the rest of the game got easier.

-------------
VIRIDIAN CITY
-------------

The old man who blocked the entrance to the Viridian Gym will now move away, letting you access it. The moment you enter it, you'll be thrown into battle with L50 Mewtwo, so be prepared to catch it! Catching Mewtwo is arguably easier than catching Ho-Oh because Mewtwo has only one damage-dealing move: Psycho Cut. Something with a healing move (like, say, Alakazam with Recover) can block Mewtwo for a long time while you're throwing Ultra Balls at it.

Once the battle is over, you go immediately into a battle with Team Rocket. Defeat them and the Gym collapses. You'll appear outside.

There's an item close to where you are. It's Earth Badge, plus TM26 (Earthquake). In addition, you can go through the wreckage of the Gym to get a Lucky Egg, an item that boosts EXP for Pokemon that holds it.

Now that you have 8 badges, Poke Marts update their inventory for the last time:
Poke Ball - 200
Great Ball - 600
Ultra Ball - 1200
Potion - 300
Super Potion - 700
Hyper Potion - 1200
Max Potion - 2500
Full Restore - 3000
Revive - 1500
Antidote - 100
Parlyz Heal - 200
Awakening - 250
Burn Heal - 250
Ice Heal - 250
Full Heal - 600
Escape Rope - 550
Repel - 350
Super Repel - 500
Max Repel - 700

Go west to Route 22

--------
ROUTE 22
--------
Wild Pokemon: Persian, *Onix, Sandslash, *Machoke, Jigglypuff, Pidgeotto, Poliwhirl. Level 35-38.

There's Machoke, but no Machop. In fact, Machop can be caught, but you will still have to wait a bit. If you want, you can catch a Machoke here and breed it for Machop.

There are 5 trainers on this route. Once you're done, enter the building at the end to get to the Indigo Plateau.

--------------
INDIGO PLATEAU
--------------

The old guy in the building is a Move Tutor for Metronome.
A guy at the upper table will give you Exp. Share.

Once you get out, you can find several vendors.
Careful: you'll eventually lose access to Indigo Plateau, so you might want to buy something.

Top left vendor sells:
Fresh Water - 200
Soda Pop - 300
Lemonade - 350
Berry Juice - 100

Top right vendor sells:
Full Incense - 9600
Lax Incense - 9600
Luck Incense - 9600
Odd Incense - 9600
Pure Incense - 9600
Rock Incense - 9600
Rose Incense - 9600
Sea Incense - 9600
Wave Incense - 9600

Bottom left vendor sells:
Cheri Berry - 200
Chesto Berry - 200
Pecha Berry - 200
Rawst Berry - 200
Aspear Berry - 200
Oran Berry - 200
Lum Berry - 600
Sitrus Berry - 800

And the bottom right vendor (Team Rocket) sells:
Cleanse Tag - 200
Destiny Knot - 200
Everstone - 200
Poke Doll - 1000
Heart Scale - 9000

What do these items actually do? Incenses have various effects when held, but they are also necessary to obtain certain Pokemon. That's because they can cause production of certain pre-evolutions when breeding. At this point, Luck Incense is the only one that can work for you: you can use it with Chansey to breed Happiny. But you'll eventually want all of them. This might be a good time to remind you that you should already have an Amulet Coin, a hold item that doubles money from battles. And if you don't, Luck Incense just happens to have the same effect.
So, which Incenses do you actually need? Assuming you don't want their battle effects and just want to breed, Full, Luck, Rock, and Sea Incense are most important, as you will have a chance to get these Pokemon in not-too-distant future. Lax Incense is unnecessary, as there will actually be a free one in the area where the relevant Pokemon appears foir the first time.
As for Odd, Pure, Rose and Wave Incenses, by the time you actually get the Pokemon that use them, you'll have an access to a permanent Incense shop, so there's no need to buy them here.

Heart Scales are used with Move Relearner, but there will be a better source of them.
Everstone might be worth picking up -- it's effect (stopping evolution) might be useful at times, but it also has a second effect, forcing parent's Nature onto a baby. And it's cheap.

Note that if you get a Happiny, you won't be able to evolve it back to a new Chansey yet -- this requires an Oval Stone which you don't have yet.

There's still a lot of trainers to get money for the remaining items, but if you need more, there are a few options.

1. Meowth
Meowth can learn an attack called "Pay Day". Whenever you use it, you get money equal to double Meowth's level at the end of the battle. Note that you must decline Meowth's evolution a few times to get it.
You can double the amount by using Amulet Coin or Luck Incense, but it's not really worth it -- even with Lv. 100 Meowth or Persian (which you're probably far from having), you'd only get 400 per Pay Day.
There's one more advantage of Meowth, though: it can have the ability Pickup and get you items as you 

2. Crime
And by "crime", I mean TM46, Thief.
A few wild Pokemon can have items. Catching a Pokemon will give you the item, obviously, but that's not financially sound since you'd be down a cost of Pokeball and, more to the point, the items themselves might be rare. There is an ability, Frisk, that can tell you whether a Pokemon has an item or not, but unfortunately, you don't have access to it yet.
What you DO have access to, though, is Butterfree. Butterfree has the ability Compoundeyes that increases chances you'll find a Pokemon with an item.

Next step is just to use Thief. Fortunately, Butterfree is able to learn it from the TM. Remember that Butterfree must not have any item, otherwise the theft won't work.

An advanced setup is to have Butterfree in the front, but fainted (its ability will still work like that), and a Pokemon with Frisk and Thief in the second spot. That way you'll get lots of items and you can steal them easily.

So, is there a good place to steal? Most items that can be obtained are not that expensive, but Mt Moon is a pretty good one. It has two good moneymakers: Parases and Clefairies/Clefables (both have greater chance to be encountered on the top floor).

Clefairy can have Moon Stone, which, apart from the fact that it's important to evolution of several Pokemon lines, can be sold for 2000. Paras, on the other hand, can have either Tiny Mushroom, or Big Mushroom. Tiny Mushroom can be sold for 250, while Big Mushroom can be sold for 2500! Compoundeyes make them appear with chance 20%, so it's a bit time-intensive but potentially profitable.

Alternatively, you might want to try Hidden Village. There are wild Parases here as well, but you can also find Staryu -- and Staryu can have Stardust or Star Piece. Even common Stardust can be sold for 1000 and Star Piece for even more money. Unfortunately, Staryu are pretty rare.

Basically: if you want to gather some Moon Stones for evolution, hit Mt Moon -- otherwise, Hidden Village might be better.

As a note: there's one more item a Paras might have: Balm Mushroom. That can sold for incredible 25,000, but it's rare, even with Compoundeyes.

As for farming specific items for their USE, I'd suggest to wait until you get Frisk.

But we'll have time for this after we go through Pokemon League!

Enter the building on Indigo Plateau.

On your left: a woman who lets you enter the league. At the left wall is Poke Mart, and at the top right is a Poke Center. After registration, you can go to the Water stage, second exit from right.

Beat the trainer and go to the Rock stage, second exit from the left.

Beat second trainer and go to the Ice stage, the middle exit.

After you beat the third trainer, you have to leave the building. Gary meets you outside. Brock is on the Plateau -- talk to him to fight.

After you beat Brock, you can continue with Indigo League -- this time on Grass stage, the rightmost exit.

Fourth trainer, and you get the right to fight on Indigo Stadium -- left exit.

And that's it! You got to Top 16, and that's the best you can get for now.

-----------
PALLET TOWN
-----------

Return home and talk to Professor Oak. He'll let you travel to the Orange Archipelago on a blimp... that is, if a Fearow didn't attack the blimps! The Fearow hides in the northern part of the Viridian Forest, but beware -- once you beat him, Indigo Plateau closes for good and you'll lose access to the shops there. So if you want to use them, now's your chance!

Once you're good, beat the Fearow -- it has only level 40, so you should have no problem with it.

We can now move further, but before that, go back to Pallet Town. In SE corner of the town will be a pink-haired girl who will give you Mew.

In addition, go to your house and to your room upstairs. Get the item that appeared there, TM102 (Crush Claw).

Nothing else to do -- go to Viridian City and use the blimp service to go to Valencia Island.

---------------
VALENCIA ISLAND
---------------
...Or not.

On the blimp, you'll be ambushed by Team Rocket. But after you defeat them, you'll end up crashing on Valencia Island. You got there!

Wild Pokemon: Butterfree, NidoranF, NidoranM, Paras, Raticate, Vileplume, Weepinbell. Level 33-37.
Cloyster can be caught here, even with Old Rod, but you might want to wait and get a Shellder later.

NE from your position, there's a visible item (Berry Juice). When you go north, you'll find a Great Ball on the northern end of the western beach.

Enter Professor Ivy's lab and grab the GS Ball.

Now that you have it, several things happen:

1. You can move between your house in Pallet Town and Professor Ivy's lab using the warps that are located there. More destinations will be added to the warps as you unlock new regions.
2. The blimp in Viridian City will now take you to the civilized part of Valencia Island.
3. The middle ship in Vermillion City (the one you used to go to Cinnabar Island) now connects to Valencia Island as well.
4. A sailor with his Lapras appear on the western beach of Valencia Island. The sailor can take you to Vermillion City or to two new destinations: Tangelo Island and Mikan Island.

--------------
TANGELO ISLAND
--------------

Few things to do here:

This is the first place that you can catch Tentacool, even with Old Rod. The other Pokemon available from fishing is Slowpoke:

The house right next to where you start has a lady who gives you a Max Revive.

One of the houses in SW corner (only one can be entered) has Pokemon Move Maniac who can teach your Pokemon any moves they forgot. Unfortunately, he requires Heart Scales to do so. Until we get a good source of them, he won't be too useful.

Pokemon Park isn't too useful, just pretty. House in SE corner can't be actually entered.

The important thing here is in the NE corner. Four trainers block your way to a Lapras. Once you beat them and talk to Lapras, you'll automatically get it.

That's all here, let's go to Mikan Island now.

------------
MIKAN ISLAND
------------

Fishing: Horsea and Staryu.

Close to where you start is a house. In the tree left of the house is a hidden Pecha Berry.
At the SE corner of the island is a Revive. Below that is a guy who gives you TM25 (Thunder)
A house on the hill in the center of the island has a trainer. After you beat him, talk to him to get TM42 (Facade).

Go to the Gym (you must have beaten Tracey, the last trainer on Tangelo Island, otherwise the entrance will be blocked).

The gym has 5 trainers plus Cissy. Beat her for Coral-Eye Badge and TM18 (Rain Dance).

Once you've beaten her, the guy in the eastern house will now give you a Water Stone. You can also get TM42 if you haven't done so yet -- you don't have to fight the trainer anymore.

Finally, Lapras Launch opens a new route: you can now go to from Tangelo Island or Mikan Island to Navel Island.

------------
NAVEL ISLAND
------------

Fishing: Magikarp and *Seel.

You start on a beach. In the NE tile of this beach is a hidden Heart Scale.
A guy on the island will give you TM83 (Work Up).

The right house contains four guys. Three of them are Move Tutors for Fire Punch, Ice Punch and Thunder Punch.

A guy in Poke Center will give you a Soft Sand.

After that, go to the cave up north. Welcome to Navel Rock.

----------
NAVEL ROCK
----------
Navel Rock has four floors: 1F, B1F, 2F, 3F and B1F. 1F and 2F share the same Pokemon list, as does B1F and 3F. Possible Pokemon are:
*Cubone - 1F and 2F only, common
Abra - B1F and 3F only, common
*Electabuzz - common on 1F and 2F, rare on B1F and 3F
Graveler - common on B1F and 3F, rare on 1F and 2F
Dugtrio - uncommon on all floors
*Diglett - uncommon on all floors
*Machop - uncommon on all floors
Ekans - uncommon on all floors
Golbat - uncommon on all floors
Zubat - rare on all floors
Koffing - very rare on all floors
*Voltorb - very rare on all floors

If you get an Electabuzz, remember that you can breed it to get an Elekid.

So, what about that Voltorb? It has 1% encounter rate, and even if encountered, it unfortunately knows Self-Destruct, so it can blow itself up. And your next chance to get one will come quite a bit later. To improve your chances, you should get a Poliwag or its evolution with the ability Damp which will cause Self-Destruct to fail. Unfortunately, they have to be pretty high-leveled so Electric-type Voltorb can't just OHKO them with its OTHER attacks... Supposedly, you could improve your chances of finding a Voltorb (well, that, or Electabuzz) by using a Pokemon with Static in the front, but from my testing, this doesn't seem to really work.

Anyway, once you're ready to do this dungeon, go up and left. Fight a trainer and get down the ladder. You'll appear in a small room with three items: PP Up, Helix Fossil and Dome Fossil. You can take these to Cinnabar Island in order to revive them into Omanyte and Kabuto, respectively. After you give him a fossil, just leave the building and come back.

Going from the entrance to the right, there will be a small space north of you with seven rocks. The leftmost rock hides a Max Revive. At the end of the path, go down the ladder.

Go along the path. Fight a trainer, and then there's a second one beyond the ladder, guarding way to an item (a Star Piece). Go up the ladder.

Next part of 1F has an item (Pearl) and a Trainer. Go up the ladder.

2F is just a straight path with a trainer at the beginning. Go up the ladder.

On 3F, go up and left. The rock in the corner hides a Fire Stone. Then go right and fight a trainer.

Right from the trainer is another ladder down. Use it when you go out -- it's much faster, but one-way, path through the Navel Rock.

For now, go out the cave into Navel Gym. There are two people here. First one is a healer who'll heal your party before the Gym Leader -- Danny.

Beat Danny for Sea Ruby Badge and TM13 (Ice Beam). Plus, Lapras Launch adds the route Mikan Island <-> Seven Grapefruit Islands, so go there.

------------------------
SEVEN GRAPEFRUIT ISLANDS
------------------------
Fishing: Goldeen + Staryu.

This place is a bit confusing: as the name says, there are seven islands which are connected by bridges into a long linear sequence. Let's call the island you start on Island 3. The island north of you is Island 2, and the island to the east of THAT is Island 1. Islands 4-7 are those you can get to by going south, in order.

Island 1:
Bunch of guys picking grapefruits. The bottom one on the right side will give you TM105 (Toxic Spikes).

Island 2:
You can get an item here (Berry Juice).

Island 3:
Nothing interesting, except for the Lapras Launch to go back to Navel Island.

Island 4:
A woman in the house here will tell you about the Snorlax problem. Since you want to go deal with it, she will let the guard know.
A guy in Pokemon Center will give you a Berry Juice.

Island 5:
This island is completely devastated by Snorlax. There are some green-ish patches left, and two of them contain hidden Berry Juices: the one at the very NE, and one roughly in the middle: go east from the bridge and it should be the secong patch you see.

Island 6:
More devastation. There's one hidden Berry Juice, in a green-ish patch: go east from the bridge, go down from the first patch and search the second one.

Island 7:
You must talk to the woman in the house on Island 4 in order to get here. There's a battle with Snorlax here (level 45) -- don't forget to catch it!

Go back to Island 4 and talk to the woman again -- you will get Leftovers. If you have caught the Snorlax, don't forget that it also had Leftovers, so you should now have two of them.

If you have bought the Incenses at Indigo Plateau, you can give Full Incense to Snorlax and breed it to get a Munchlax.

You can now use the Lapras Launch to reach the next island, Trovita.

--------------
TROVITA ISLAND
--------------

While it's possible to fish here, no encounters are defined and so you can't catch anything.

Not much to do here. Lorelei from Elite Four is in front of the gym and you have to fight her to get in. The Gym itself has four trainers plus Rudy. Beating Rudy will give you the Spike Shell Badge plus TM67 (Retaliate). It will also unlock the next stage of Lapras Launch, routes Seven Grapefruits Islands <-> Ascorbia Island and Trovita Island <-> Ascorbia Island.

---------------
ASCORBIA ISLAND
---------------
Fishing: Goldeen and *Shellder.
Wild Pokemon: Paras, Beedrill, *Psyduck, Butterfree, Krabby, Staryu, Parasect). Level 35-39

Just a bit SE from where you land is a house with a guy who will give you a Burn Heal.

Go to the northern part of the island through a long grassy path with five trainers (the fourth of them is Tracey). Enter the house at the end for another battle against Team Rocket.

Once you beat them, collect TM89 (U-Turn) from truins and go to Aidan's house (the one next to a corral full of Squirtles and their evolutions) and talk to him to get a Yellow Scarf. The Lapras Launch will now add routes Trovita Island <-> Kumquat Island and Ascorbia Island <-> Kumquat Island.

--------------
KUMQUAT ISLAND
--------------

Nothing much here, just the gym. There are two trainers (double battle) and Luana. Beat her for Jade Star Badge and TM33 (Reflect). And the route Kumquat Island <-> Pummelo Island is now open.

--------------
PUMMELO ISLAND
--------------

Fishing: Horsea and Staryu.
Wild Pokemon: Sandslash, Golem, Magneton, Nidorina, Wigglytuff, Kadabra, Arcanine, Nidorino, Arbok, Exeggutor, Dragonair (rare). Usual level 40-42 (Dragonairs have 45).
Note that this is a premium leveling spot -- not only are the Pokemon high-leveled, but they are also all evolved forms which give significantly more EXP! With Lucky Egg, Exp. Share and your legendary Pokemon, you can get a lot here.

Careful when interacting with Lapras Launch here -- you can go to Valencia, but it's a one-way trip; going back to Pummelo will take several more trips.

First you have to fight Misty who blocks the entrance to the Stadium. Inside the Stadium is Poke Center and a guy on the left who works like Poke Mart. The lady behind the desk on the bottom registers you for the fight with Drake. Then talk to the guy blocking the top exit and fight Drake.

Defeating Drake unlocks a new route: Pummel Island <-> Element Islands. Plus a few more things, but we should get to Element Islands first.

---------------
ELEMENT ISLANDS
---------------
Weather forecast: Stormy

There are three islands, Ice, Lightning and Fire one. You start at the Ice island and Lapras Launch can transport you to other islands as well as back to Pummelo Island. Ice island has Articuno on it, Lightning island has Zapdos and Fire island has Moltres. All three are level 50. Get them.

And we're done with Orange Islands! Next up, Johto!

Go to Valencia Island and teleport home to Pallet Town.

-----------
PALLET TOWN
-----------

Go to Professor Oak's Lab. Gary blocks the stairs; waste him.

Talk to Professor Oak in his lab and we're officially on the road to Johto. Go to Indigo Plateau; the western exit from the gate building will be open now.

--------
ROUTE 45
--------

The way west is blocked by a pair of fighting trainers. Follow the path south.

-------------
NEW BARK TOWN
-------------

Go to the Professor Elm's Lab in the NW corner. There's a teleport in his lab which connects to other two (Pallet Town and Valencia Island). You can now teleport freely between the three regions.

Go west to route 29.

--------
ROUTE 29
--------
Wild Pokemon: *Heracross, *Spinarak, Pinsir, Butterfree, *Stantler, NidoranF, NidoranM. Usual level 5-6.

Since you're in a new region, wild Pokemon levels dropped significantly. Use False Swipe so your high-level Pokemon won't knock the wild Pokemon out. You should have a TM for it -- or at the very least, Cubone has it naturally.

The most important thing here is Stantler. Try to get a Stantler with a Frisk ability -- fortunately, its second ability is Intimidate which shows itself in battle. If you meet a Stantler and it won't reduce your attack, it has Frisk and you should get it.

Frisk will reveal an item held by opposing Pokemon (if any) once you encounter it. Combined with Butterfree's Compoundeyes (which, as I've said before, increase the chance of meeting Pokemon with items), you will get a powerful team for item farming (don't forget to teach Thief to your Stantler).
For maximum speed, you can make your Butterfree faint. That way, Compoundeyes will still work but Stantler will enter the battle first so you don't have to switch it in (after all, if you start with Butterfree, you can just have THAT use Thief). Or you can just give Stantler a Smoke Ball and immediately run from anything uninteresting (of course, then you need someone else with Thief to actually steal the item). Also, if you're doing this, have some items ready to heal your Stantler -- using a Poke Center would revive Butterfree and you'd have to make it faint again.

But before we do that, there's a Chikorita on this Route. Talk to it and it will run away. Follow it north to the snowy forest. You can catch a *Hoothoot here (rarely, Haunters and Gengars appear as well). You shouldn't use False Swipe here -- this location has permanent hailstorm and Hoothoot will be KO'd by the hail. Instead wait a bit until its HP are dropped and then catch it. Or use Sunny Day/Rain Dance to change the weather and then use False Swipe.

Talk to Chikorita again and you can grab it for yourself!

Continue west to Cherrygrove City.

----------------
CHERRYGROVE CITY
----------------

Nothing too important here, except fishing -- Woopers can be caught in this town. There is a new teleporter in Poke Center, but we can't use her services yet.

Before we go further...

STOP AND FRISK SECTION
a.k.a. Thievery for fun and profit.

With combination of Compoundeyes and Frisk, you have a good chance to grab some new items. Technically, you could have gotten them before, but Frisk makes it less time-consuming.

Once you get what you want, continue north from Cherrygrove City to Route 30.

--------
ROUTE 30
--------
Wild Pokemon: *Ledyba, Hoothoot, Spinarak, Caterpie, Weedle, Metapod, Kakuna, Pidgey. Level 5-7.

Get Potion in the first grass patch.
Two other items you will get to are Antidote and Poke Ball.

Next to a house is an Apricorn tree which will give you a random Apricorn.

There are 4 trainers on the route.

At the end of the route is a gate. Continue west to Violet City.

-----------
VIOLET CITY
-----------
Fishing: Magikarp and *Marill.
If you got Sea Incense, you can breed Marill to get Azurill.

There's a Potion north of where you come in. You have to go around the Poke Center to reach it.
There's another Apricot Tree in the SW part of the city.
There's a hidden Poke Ball in the NW corner of the island in the lake.

The school (house north of Poke Center) has a trainer inside.
The NW house has a guy who wants to trade your Bellsprout for his Onix.

The gym has two trainers and Falkner. However, Falkner won't fight you because he needs to do something about the Sprout Tower. Go there and you'll fight Team Rocket again.
There are two old guys at the top. Talk to the left one to fight him and get TM70 (Flash) as a reward. Once you obtain it, you can fight Falkner for Zephyr Badge and TM40 (Aerial Ace). Johto Poke Center teleports start to work now, connecting Cherrygrove City and Violet City.

There are two routes leading from Violet City: Route 32 to the south and Route 36 through the gate building to the west. Let's start west.

--------
ROUTE 36
--------
Wild Pokemon: Pidgey, Hoothoot, NidoranF, NidoranM, Vulpix, Growlithe, Stantler (rare).

As you can see, there's nothing new. Moreover, the way west is blocked. However, we can still visit the Ruins of Alph to the south.

-------------
RUINS OF ALPH
-------------

The cave contains nothing but Unowns. There are four items -- Leppa Berry is left from the entrance, the other 3 (Stardust, Great Ball and TM16 (Lunge)) are on the linear path through the ruins.

I suggest to have an empty spot in your party. Catch one extra Unown, put it in the front spot and give it to the man in the house next to the ruins to obtain a Psychic Gem.

That's all we can do here for now (though you might want to search the ruins for a while to register all 28 forms of Unown into your Pokedex -- no need to catch or even defeat them, you just have to meet them), so return to Violet City and go south to Route 32.

--------
ROUTE 32
--------
Wild Pokemon: Hoothoot, *Mareep, *Sentret, Oddish, Diglett, Gloom, Primeape, Machoke, *Hitmonlee, *Hitmonchan, Vileplume. Level 6-8.
Fishing: Magikarp and Goldeen.

Many new Pokemon here. Note that you can breed Hitmonlee or Hitmonchan with Ditto to obtain Tyrogue, who you can then evolve into Hitmontop. That requires its ATK and DEF to be the same, so it might require some finagling.

Talk to the first guy you meet to obtain a Miracle Seed. Fight three trainers, then there will be a big patch of tall grass on the left. A Super Potion is hidden on the only non-grass tile inside.

A Great Ball is hidden on the tile just in front of the cave entrance.

Enter the cave (Charicific Valley). You won't be allowed to pass unless you have a Charizard with you. If you do, the woman will fight you. After you beat her, she'll join the ranks of Day Care trainers. In the back of the cave, among Charizards, is TM43 (Flame Charge).

After that, Route 32 splits a bit. Left path (over land) contains a trainer and ends with a Great Ball. Right part (bridge) starts with a guy who gives you a Heart Scale and continues with three trainers. Then two more trainers and you're done with this route.

Continue south to Route 33.

--------
ROUTE 33
--------
Wild Pokemon: *Pineco, Mareep, Sentret, Oddish, Hoothoot, Diglett. Level 9-14.

Go to the right. Fight a trainer and you'll find a Cyndaquil. Take it with you.

Continue west to the Azalea Town.

-----------
AZALEA TOWN
-----------

West of the house with yellow roof and a chimney is a Full Heal hidden in a rock.

A man in PokeMart will give you a Blu Apricorn.

There's Slowpoke Well in this town, which is exactly what it says on the tin -- a small cave with nothing but Slowpokes inside. If you want more Lagging Tails for some reason, this is the best place to farm them.

In the NW corner is Kurt's house. There's another Apricot tree there. Unfortunately you can't get inside because Brock blocks the door. Fight him and he'll move.

Go inside and talk to Kurt. Give him your GS Ball and you'll get a Lure Ball and a Fast Ball in return.
You can now give Apricorns to Kurt and he'll make special Pokeballs from them:

Blk Apricorn -> Heavy Ball
Blu Apricorn -> Lure Ball
Grn Apricorn -> Friend Ball
Pnk Apricron -> Love Ball
Red Apricorn -> Level Ball 
Wht Apricorn -> Fast Ball
Ylw Apricorn -> Moon Ball

Of course, you will eventually encounter a shop that sells these Poke Balls without going through any of the "once per day" thing. And they are actually pretty cheap. So... you know, do whatever you want with them -- they are not THAT important.

Go to the gym. It has 4 trainers plus Bugsy. Beat him for the Hive Badge and TM81 (X-Scissor). Azalea Town will be connected to the Johto teleport system.

Once you do both quests in this town (Gym and GS Ball handoff), you can leave through the western exit to Ilex Forest.

-----------
ILEX FOREST
-----------
Wild Pokemon: *Farfetch'd, *Snubbull, Hoothoot, Pidgey, *Houndour, Beedrill, *Eevee, Onix, Noctowl, Ursaring. Level 11-14.

Note Eevee, especially. You probably have, or can grab, evolution stones to get Vaporeon, Jolteon and Flareon. Espeon and Umbreon require happiness. Leafeon and Glaceon require specific locations. For Sylveon, you just need to learn Charm, then level up.

Also note that Farfetch'd can have Stick -- try to get one from them for your own Farfetch'd!

Go and fight the first trainer. At the fork, go right. There's another trainer and a Revive.
Go to the left and grab a Full Heal hidden on the second empty tile from the left inside a grass patch. Then grab a visible item (5 Lure Balls!). Continue west to Pokemon Swap Meet.

-----------------
POKEMON SWAP MEET
-----------------

You start next to a Apricorn Shop. It sells:

Red Apricorn - 200
Blu Apricorn - 200
Ylw Apricorn - 200
Grn Apricorn - 200
Wht Apricorn - 200
Blk Apricorn - 200

Along the path is:

Poke Center -- nothing too interesting. It's not even a part of the teleport system.

A guy who will battle you if you have a Tauros as your front Pokemon. When you beat him, he will give you a Life Orb.
Afterwards, he'll offer to trade your Tauros for his Nidoqueen.

Next is a girl who offers to trade your Corsola for her Lickitung.

Next is another vendor:
Fresh Water - 200
Soda Pop - 300
Lemonade - 350
Berry Juice - 100

Probably moved here from Indigo Plateau...

Near the fountain are two more traders: one trades your Tauros for their Rhyhorn, and the other trades your Ninetales for their Porygon (chance for those of you who didn't feel like grinding 9999 coins).

On the right is another vendor with Indigo Plateau goods:
Cheri Berry - 200
Chesto Berry - 200
Pecha Berry - 200
Rawst Berry - 200
Aspear Berry - 200
Oran Berry - 200
Lum Berry - 600
Sitrus Berry - 800

And further right is a guy who trades your Butterfree for his Bellossom.

The NW part has two more traders: your Teddiursa for their Igglybuff and your Mankey for their Aipom.

Aidan is at the burning house in NW corner (don't worry, it's just a drill). If you have a Squirtle, Wartortle, or Blastoise with you, he will let you train your Pokemon, either here or at his home on Ascorbia Island. Like with Anthony, the Pokemon deposited at one location can be picked up at another.

This is all here (no Incense shop, sadly). Continue NE to next part of Ilex Forest.

-----------
ILEX FOREST
-----------

Soon you'll encounter Misty again and fight her. Once you defeat her, fight the Totodile -- unlike Chikorita and Cyndaquil, you don't get it for free, so be ready!

Continue along the path. There's a dead end with a trainer and battle against shiny Noctowl -- catch it, shiny Pokemon are rare!

Next, grab an item along the path (Big Mushroom) and go through the gate house to Route 34.

--------
ROUTE 34
--------
Wild Pokemon: *Girafarig, Sandshrew, Sentret, Paras, Voltorb, Oddish, Exeggcute, Slowpoke, Gloom, Fearow. Level 13-15.
Fishing: Krabby and Staryu.

Note: Girafarigs may have Persim Berry, you might want to get some for your collection.

There are 7 trainers on this route.
The patch of grass on the right of where you enter has a hidden Super Potion in the NW corner.
In the big grass patch on the left is a girl who will give you a Water Stone.
Close to the fence, there's an empty tile in the grass. It hides a Rare Candy.
The last grass patch has a visible Nugget.

Continue north to Goldenrod City.

--------------
GOLDENROD CITY
--------------

Big city with lots to do.

House on the east side of the city has a Status Judge who will tell you some vague data about the stats of your Pokemon.

Go to the Bike Shop. The guy inside will give you TM36 (Sludge Bomb).

DJ Mary on the right side of Radio Tower will give you Mystic Water.

The house in the NW part of the city has another Name Rater.

The house next to the Gym is a flower shop, selling:
Growth Mulch - 200
Damp Mulch - 200
Stable Mulch - 200
Gooey Mulch - 200

There is a tunnel connecting north and south part of the city. 4 trainers are inside. In a side branch is a Revive, and right left to it, a hidden Max Ether.

There is a Game Corner here, like in Celadon City -- but it's (barring some internal rearrangements) exactly the same, including the prizes, so nothing new here.

Next is the Department Store. It's similar to the one in Saffron City.

2F: A girl here will give you TM98 (Drill Peck).

Top cashier sells:
Hyper Potion - 1200
Max Potion - 2500
Full Restore - 3000
Revive - 1500
Full Heal - 600

Bottom cashier sells:
Poke Ball - 200
Great Ball - 600
Ultra Ball - 1200
Full Heal - 600
Escape Rope - 550
Max Repel - 700

3F: A girl behind the counter is a Move Tutor for Bind.

4F: The cashier here sells:
Poke Doll - 1000
Fire Stone - 2100
Thunderstone - 2100
Water Stone - 2100
Leaf Stone - 2100
Sun Stone - 3000

5F: Two cashiers here. The top one sells:
HP Up - 9800
Protein - 9800
Iron - 9800
Calcium - 9800
Zinc - 9800
Carbos - 9800

Bottom one sells:
X Attack - 500
X Defend - 550
X Speed - 350
X Special - 350
X Sp.Def - 350
X Accuracy - 950
Guard Spec - 700
Dire Hit - 650

And that's all! The only thing to do is to hit the Gym. It contains 4 trainers plus Whitney. Beat her for Plain Badge and TM45 (Attract). Goldenrod City will be added to Johto teleport network, but more importantly, the Magnet Train will now let you travel between Goldenrod City and Saffron City! This cuts travel time between regions considerably since you no longer have to walk over Pokemon-infested route between New Bark Town and Cherrygrove City.

Finally, the guy on Route 36 FINALLY found his Pokeball and no longer blocks the route. But we will go north to Route 35 instead for now.

--------
ROUTE 35
--------
Wild Pokemon: Pidgey, NidoranF, *Yanma, NidoranM, Abra, Drowzee, Ditto, Hoothoot. Level 12-18.
Note that Yanma can hold a new item, Wide Lens -- you might want to grab one. But you have to go past 6 of 8 trainers here to even get to some grass! Seventh trainer is in the grass patch. Go south, then west, to find a Nugget in an enclosed area. Then go all the way south where you'll fight the eighth trainer and find a HP Up.

Go east to National Park Entrance.

-------------
NATIONAL PARK
-------------
Wild Pokemon: Pidgey, Caterpie, Weedle, *Sunkern, Metapod, Kakuna. Level 10-14.
Bug-catching Contest: Pineco, Weedle, Beedrill, Caterpie, Paras, Venomoth, Scyther, Spinarak, Pinsir. Level 15-18.

On Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday is the Bug-catching contest where you enter the Park with a single Pokemon and use Sport Balls to catch various Bug types. Note that you might try to get a Shed Shell from Venomoths here. If you win, you get a random evolution stone. This can be:
Fire Stone, Thunderstone, Water Stone, Leaf Stone, or Sun Stone (we can already buy those).
Moon Stone (we can steal these from Clefairies and Clefables).
Dusk Stone, Dawn Stone, Shiny Stone, Oval Stone (we can't get these yet; note that Oval Stone is necessary to evolve Happiny, if you got one).

Second prize is Everstone, third prize Sitrus Berry, and the consolation prize is Shed Shell.

A girl in the Pavillion will give you a Quick Claw if you give her a Beedrill. Do so if you catch an extra Beedrill in the Contest.

Apart from the contest, Sunkern might hold a Coba Berry, a new type.

There are four trainers in the park.

Go east from the Pavillion to Route 36.

--------
ROUTE 36
--------

There are 2 trainers on the way through (to the spot where the boy looking for his Pokeball was blocking the way).

The way north is blocked by Sudowoodo -- fight it and catch it. If you bought your Incenses, you can use a Rock Incense to breed a Bonsly.

After getting Sudowoodo, continue northwest and grab a Hyper Potion. Then northeast to the last trainer on this Route, who will give you Old Amber when you beat him. This will allow you to get an Aerodactyl back on Cinnabar Island.

Continue north to Route 37.

--------
ROUTE 37
--------
Wild Pokemon: Ledyba, Pidgey, NidoranF, NidoranM, Vulpix, Growlithe, Spinarak, Hoothoot, Pidgeotto, Stantler.

Go north and beat the two trainers in a double battle; as always, you can fight them twice by talking to one, then the other.

Further north, you'll run into Gary who's fighting with another trainer. Talk to him to get him to leave.

Get an Ether hidden in the flower left of the grass patch.

Go north and fight two more trainers. Go east, and jump down the ledge into an area with two more trainers and three Apricorn trees.

Go through the route north again and enter Ecruteak City.

-------------
ECRUTEAK CITY
-------------
Fishing: Poliwag.

First things first, there are three hidden items: a Hyper Potion between purple flowers, one tile NW from the signpost with the city name, an Ultra Ball in the flowerbox next to a house to the north of that, and a Rare Candy between two purple flowers by the pond.

Kimono Dance Theater (a house with a sign next to it) contains an automatic battle against five trainers. When you beat them, you get TM30 (Shadow Ball).

House left to that contains a guy who gives you the Itemfinder.

You can't get into the Gym, so go north to the Burned Tower. The moment you enter, you'll see a scene and get into another fight with Team Rocket. After you beat them, Morty returns to the Gym, so you can go challenge it.

Burned Tower also contains some wild Pokemon: Gastly, Haunter, Rattata, Zubat, Koffing, and Magmar, at levels 15-19.

The Gym contains 4 trainers plus Morty. Beat him to get Fog Badge and TM65 (Shadow Claw). Ecruteak City is added to Johto teleport system.

The way east is blocked, so go west to Route 38.

--------
ROUTE 38
--------
Wild Pokemon: *Teddiursa, *Murkrow, *Dunsparce, Spinarak, Sunkern, Sunflora, Ursaring, *Wobbuffet (rare). Level 15-22
Fishing: *Remoraid.

If you are frustrated by Wobbuffet's rarity, don't worry -- there will be a gift Wynaut later.

Apart from some new Pokemon (including a rare Wobbuffet!), there are 5 trainers and 2 items, both visible, and in the same grass patch: a Lax Incense (top) and a Max Potion (bottom). Lax Incense could be bought previously at Indigo Plateau, but here it is for free -- you can use it to breed Wynauts if you got yourself a Wobbuffet.

Continue west to Route 39.

--------
ROUTE 39
--------
Wild Pokemon: *Aipom, *Smeargle, *Miltank, Ledian, *Natu, Azumarill, Rhydon, *Kecleon, Exeggutor, *Hoppip (quite rare). Level 15-20.
Fishing: Seaking and Remoraid.

Note that Natu has Teleport and can flee from the battle. If you got a Wobbuffet, you can use it to prevent this.

There are four trainers on the main north-south path.

The fenced area to the west contains two hidden items. Their location is hard to describe (you might want to use the Itemfinder here), but I'll try:

To find the first item, line yourself horizontally with the right edge of grass patch to the south. The line yourself vertically with the top right flower in the meadow to the right. You are now standing one tile south of the item (X Attack).

The second item is three tiles southwest from the first item. It's a PP Up.

Apart from these two hidden items, there's also a visible item in the grass patch. It's a Nugget.

In the NW corner of the route is a house. Once you enter, you have to beat five trainers inside in order to get to the prize (a King's Rock). You are suggested to bring a heavy Pokemon. The heaviest Pokemon that you can have at this point is a Snorlax (460.0 kg). Second best choice is Steelix (if you have stolen some Metal Coats and evolved an Onix) with 400.0 kg, and third best choice is Golem (300.0 kg). It will somewhat help against Heavy Slams you'll face here, but it's far from necessary.

Note that you can only enter Sumo Competition once, so save beforehand. On the other hand, there are other ways to get a King's Rock.

Continue south to Olivine City.

------------
OLIVINE CITY
------------
Fishing: Krabby and Marill.

A guy in a house in the NE corner will trade your Krabby for his Voltorb.

A woman at the south edge of the town will give you a Soothe Bell. This item increases happiness when a Pokemon holds it -- you can use it to more easily achieve happiness evolutions.

The Gym is inaccessible, so go to the Glitter Lighthouse in the SE corner of the city.

------------------
GLITTER LIGHTHOUSE
------------------

1F: 2 trainers, nothing else.
2F: 3 trainers and an item (Ether).
3F: 2 trainers.
4F: 2 trainers and an item (Super Potion).
5F: Jasmine is here. She'll send you to Cianwood City.

Once you talk to Jasmine, the ship in the harbor will take you to Cianwood City!

-------------
CIANWOOD CITY
-------------
Fishing: Poliwag and Shellder.

Two of the rocks here contain hidden items:

Go north from where you start, then left when you hit the sea. First rock you pass contains a Max Ether. Then go to the very north of the city. There are four rocks on a ledge. A revive is hidden in the second rock from the left.

A house with a sign is a Pharmacy. Talk to the clerk to send medicine to Jasmine's Ampharos. You can also buy stuff here:
EnergyPowder - 500
HealPowder - 450
Energy Root - 800
Revival Herb - 2800
Poke Ball - 200

Herbs are powerful, but they decrease happiness of Pokemon you use them onto, so bear that in mind.

Well, the ship has conveniently broken down and not even the teleport in the Pokemon Center works. We'll have to hit the gym.

The Gym has 4 trainers (first two will fight you together, and second two can as well) plus Chuck. Beating him gives you Storm Badge and TM31 (Brick Break).

Teleport in Poke Center still doesn't work, but the ship works, so take that. Except that instead of Olivine City, you'll end up on Red Rock Isle.

-------------
RED ROCK ISLE
-------------
Fishing: Seel and Krabby.

There is a second ship here, ready to take you around the Whirl Islands. There are four in total: Red Rock Isle, Yellow Rock Isle, Blue Rock Isle and Ogi Isle. Go to Yellow Rock Isle first.

----------------
YELLOW ROCK ISLE
----------------
Fishing: *Corsola.
Note that Corsola may hold a Hard Stone, item that powers up Rock moves -- you might want to get

Misty is here. Beat her again. Then go to Blue Rock Isle.

--------------
BLUE ROCK ISLE
--------------
Fishing: Horsea, Goldeen.

This island has two visible items: Zinc in SW corner and Lum Berry in NE corner.

Talk to the woman at the north edge and you'll register for the whirl cup. You have to beat Misty before she lets you register.

Go back to Red Rock Isle and talk to the guy at the north edge, close to a ship. He'll transport you to Whirl Cup. Whirl Cup is a series of four trainer battles. After beating each trainer, talk to them to get to the next fight. At the end you'll get a Mystic Water.

Once you win, the ship to Olivine City is working again, but before we take it, let's go to Ogi Isle.

--------
OGI ISLE
--------
Fishing: Tentacool.

Now that you've beat Whirl Cup, Lugia appears on this isle. Save the game, fight it and catch it. It's only level 35 while previous legendaries were 50, so it will be a bit easier.

Go back to Red Rock Isle and take the second boat to Olivine City. There are several new things. For one, the ship in Olivine City will now connect to Cianwood City, Red Rock Isle, and Vermillion City (and the ship in Vermillion City that goes to Cinnabar Island and Valencia Island will now travel to Olivine City as well).

But more importantly, next part of the Safari Zone is unlocked!

-----------
SAFARI ZONE
-----------

Top right exit from the main Safari Zone is now open.

Wild Pokemon: Elekid, Magby, *Smoochum, Houndour, Mareep, *Shuckle, Jumpluff, Murkrow, Furret, *Larvitar, *Misdreavus (rare), Wobbuffet (rare). Level 30-38.
Fishing: Wooper and *Chinchou.

We never found Jynx, so this is the first encounter with that family. Elekid and Magby are new if you haven't bred Electabuzz and Magmar. Lots of Pokemon to catch, at any rate.

Once you're done, return to Olivine City. Both Olivine City and Cianwood City are now accessible through Johto teleport system.

------------
OLIVINE CITY
------------

The path to the Gym is now blocked by Brock. Beat him.

The Gym itself has just 2 trainers + Jasmine. Beating Jasmine gets you Mineral Badge and TM91 (Flash Cannon)

Go to Ecruteak City. Raikou, Entei and Suicune appear in the Burned Tower and can be fought and caught. Note that they have level 35 and Raikou and Entei have Roar -- you need a Pokemon with level higher than 35, otherwise they can kick you out of the battle. When you're done, continue east to Route 42.

--------
ROUTE 42
--------
Wild Pokemon: Exeggcute, *Kangaskhan, Tyrogue, Natu, Aipom, Mankey, Primeape, Xatu, Butterfree, Sandshrew, Tauros (rare), Teddiursa (rare). Level 25-28.
Fishing: Skiploom and Wooper.

Note that the only grass patch is almost at the end of the route. Kangaskhan is the only new Pokemon here, but you might want to grab a Tyrogue if you haven't bred your own yet.

First of all, grab a Max Potion hidden in a boulder north of you. Then talk to the gentleman; he will give you a Phanpy egg (it will hatch pretty quickly, too).

There's also a Day Care here, mysteriously connected to all other Pokemon training spots.

Going east, you will see a group of 3 rocks. A Super Potion is hidden in the leftmost one.

Next is a small grove with 3 Apricorn trees.

At the next lake is a trainer with a Water Stone next to him. Later yet, you'll find 2 more trainers... and that's all. Continue east and north to Route 43.

--------
ROUTE 43
--------
Weather forecast: Occasionally rainy
Wild Pokemon: Caterpie, Weedle, Teddiursa, Oddish, Spinarak, Rattata, Aipom. Level 25-28.

Once you enter this route, you'll encounter Team Rocket for another battle. After that, there are 5 other Team Rocket trainers (two of them amush you together), plus one visible item (a Max Ether). Continue north to Lake of Rage.

------------
LAKE OF RAGE
------------
Weather forecast: Rainy
Fishing: Magikarp.

Start by going north along the west side of the lake. There will be another Team Rocket trainer, and then a Full Heal. Continue along the shore until your path is blocked with a boulder. A Max Revive is hidden in it.

When you go along the right path, you will find three more Team Rocket trainers and a Rare Candy. Once you try to go north, you'll encounter Lance who'll give you a choice: fight a shiny Gyarados or a Team Rocket trainer. Note that Lance will give you a Master Ball for beating the trainer, so it's not a trivial choice!

Anyway, afterwards you can continue east to Mahogany Town.

-------------
MAHOGANY TOWN
-------------
Weather forecast: Occasionally rainy

This is a very small town -- there's nothing to do here but hit the gym.

The gym contains 5 trainers plus Pryce. When you beat him, he will give you Glacier Badge plus TM07 (Hail). Mahogany Town will be also added to the Johto teleport network.

Continue east to Route 44.

--------
ROUTE 44
--------
Wild Pokemon: Oddish, Cleffa, Magcargo, Clefairy, Gloom, Aipom, Parasect, Vileplume, Bellossom, Spinarak, Ursaring (fairly rare).
Fishing: Chinchou and *Qwilfish.

If you haven't bred Clefairy yet, here's your chance to get a Cleffa. Magcargo is here, but you can catch a Slugma later.

The route starts with an Apricorn tree. Soon afterwards, it splits in a northern and southern path.

Northern path: Item (an Ultra Ball) and two trainers.
Southern path: Item in the grass (an Elixir), four trainers and another item (Max Repel).
One last trainer is at the end, close to the cave entrance.

Enter the Ice Cave.

--------
ICE CAVE
--------
Wild Pokemon: *Delibird, *Swinub, Aipom, Piloswine, *Sneasel, Jynx, Zubat. Level 28-31

At the beginning of the cave is Nurse Joy who can heal your party.
This cave contains some ice sliding puzzles. There are three items inside: Nevermeltice, Iron and TM63 (Embargo).

At the end, exit into Blackthorn City.

---------------
BLACKTHORN CITY
---------------
Fishing: Magikarp and Poliwag.

The western house has a guy who will trade your Dodrio for his Dragonair.
The SW house has Move Relearner and Move Deleter.

The gym contains 5 trainers (2 of which can be fought together), plus Clair.

Clair, however, leaves early. Follow her out of the gym. There's now a bridge over water with Liza (Day Care) on the other bank. Enter the Dragon's Den.

------------
DRAGON'S DEN
------------
Wild Pokemon: Dratini, Larvitar, Sentret, Rattata, Sunflora, Bellsprout, Dragonair, Seadra, Odddish. Level 27-30.

This would not be so bad if there was some sort of, I don't know, visibility? Step by step instructions:

Go up and fight a trainer.
Go right, up, and right again. You'll get to four piles of rocks. The southernmost one has a Revive.
Step one space down and fight a second trainer.
Go around the trainer all the way up and search the dead end to get a Max Ether. This path is normally blocked by the trainer so you can only get here after you fight him.
Go back to the crossroads left from the piles of rock.
Go left and up. You'll find the third (and last) trainer, as well as a visible item (a Max Potion).
Go down, left, and up. At the end of the corridor, go right.
There are three paths branching from the horizontal corridor you're in. The second one has a visible Calcium at the end. The third one leads to Dragon Holy Land.

----------------
DRAGON HOLY LAND
----------------

Right upon entering, you'll be forced into yet another battle with Team Rocket. Afterwards, talk to Clair to get a Dragon Fang. Clair will now return back to her Gym. Go back there and fight her again. You'll get a Rising Badge and a TM02 (Dragon Claw).

Blackthorn City is now added to Johto teleport system. The way east from Blackthorn City opens. It leads to Route 45, where you started Johto. The route is now fully open. The old man on this road is Move Tutor for Heat Wave.

Go north to Silver Conference.

-----------------
SILVER CONFERENCE
-----------------
Wild Pokemon: Sneasel, Machoke, Machop, Voltorb, Murkrow, Misdreavus, Ponyta, Ursaring, Tangela, Onix, Larvitar (rare), Donphan (rare). Level 35-38.

Inside the League Building you start by meeting Gary. There is also Aidan who works as Day Care, a Poke Center, and a guy on the far left who functions as a Poke Mart. Register in the lower left corner and talk to the person in upper left corner.

In the first round, you must beat 3 trainers. Second round (2nd guy from the left) is just a single trainer, as is the third round (second guy from the right). Fourth round (against Gary) is reached by talking to the middle guy. For the final round (against Harrison), talk to the middle guy again.

And that's it -- we never get to the Finals Stadium, unfortunately.

When you leave Silver Conference, Misty blocks your way and you have to fight her.

And that's it for Johto! We've passed through Gen 2!

JOHTO ITEM CHECK

This seems like a good time to update the item farming guide now that we have access to all Johto areas.

1. Consumables.
Berry Juice -- Appears on Shuckle (always). Shuckles only appear in Safari Zone Johto, but on the other hand, they always have Berry Juice on them. Better to buy them, probably.
Moo Moo Milk -- Appears on Miltank (always). The only place to farm them is Route 39.
Sacred Ash -- Appears on Ho-Oh (always). If you want to farm them (why?), they are on Route 1.

1. Berries.

Chilan Berry -- Appears on Rattata and Raticate. Best place to farm them is Route 16 and Route 17.
Coba Berry -- Appears on Sunkern. Best place to farm them is National Park.

Go to Professor Oak's Lab and talk to him. Then go to Vermillion City. The leftmost ship in the docks will take you to Littleroot Town.

---------------
LITTLEROOT TOWN
---------------
Fishing: *Wingull

Go to Professor Birch's Lab. You'll be thrown into a battle against May. DEMOLISH HER.

Grab the Poke Ball with Torchic. The teleport in Professor Birch's Lab will now connect you with similar teleports in Kanto, Orange Islands and Johto for fast inter-regional travel.

The north exit was previously blocked, but once you talk to Birch, you can go up to Route 101.

---------
ROUTE 101
---------
Wild Pokemon: *Poochyena, *Duskull, Marill, Wingull, Azurill, Azumarill. Level 3-5.

ROUTE 104
---------
Wild Pokemon: Poochyena, *Shroomish, *Taillow, Wingull, Stantler, Aipom, Spinarak, Bellossom, Marill. Level 4-6.
Fishing: Lotad and Wingull.

In this first part of Route 104 are three trainers and one item (a Stick).

Continue to the trees and enter Petalburg Woods.

---------------
PETALBURG WOODS
---------------
Wild Pokemon: Wurmple, Taillow, Shroomish, *Cacnea, *Seviper, Ekans, Koffing, Sentret (rare), Pinsir (rare). Level 4-8.

This is the first place where you can obtain Leafeon. Simply level up an Eevee here.

You start near an item (an Antidote). Continue right along the way. When you reach the second grass patch, search an empty corner (empty tile in a 2x2 square of otherwise grass) for a Poke Ball. You'll find a trainer there. Continue right and down. Jump the ledge and grab an item (another Antidote). When you exit the grass patch, go down and left to find a Treecko. Fight it and catch it. Continue up, fight a second trainer, jump down the ledge and go left and up to get out of the woods. You'll end up in a northern part of Route 104.

---------
ROUTE 104
---------

There is a Revive hidden behind the house, on the last tile next to the water.

The house contains a berry shop, selling:
Cheri Berry - 200

Pecha Berry - 200
Rawst Berry - 200
Aspear Berry - 200
Oran Berry - 200
Lum Berry - 600

Next, you'll come to twins for a double battle. You can do this battle twice by talking to one twin, then the other.

On the path, you'll find 3 more trainers and 2 visible items: Poke Ball and Super Potion.

If you go north on the eastern part of the fence, you can grab a Float Stone in a separated part of Rustboro City.

Continue north to Rustboro City.

-------------
RUSTBORO CITY
-------------
A boy in the town is a Move Tutor for Iron Tail.

Enter the school (house next to Pokemon Center) and you'll encounter Team Rocket again. Beat them.

The house in SE part of the city has a trader who trades your Seedot for his Makuhita. The other guy in the house will give you a Premier Ball.

The Devon Corporation building has another fossil revival guy on the top floor.

Since you've resolved Team Rocket problem, you can enter the gym. It contains 3 trainers and Roxanne. Beat her for Stone Badge and TM69 (Rock Polish). Teleport system in Hoenn starts working.

But wait, there's more! Go to the Devon Corporation and talk to the guy in the upper right part of the lobby to obtain another Exp. Share -- those always come in handy.

Just below the Devon Corporation is Mr. Briney's house. Now that you've beaten the Gym, he'll offer you to go to Dewford Town.

------------
DEWFORD TOWN
------------
Fishing: Tentacool and Wingull.

There are two trainers in the NE corner of the town.
An old man in the NW corner will give you a Silk Scarf.
A guy in a house south of the boat will give you a Moon Stone.

The gym has three trainers plus Brawly. When you beat him, he'll tell you to fight again on Route 106. The only way from the town is the Granite Cave, so go there.

------------
GRANITE CAVE
------------
Wild Pokemon: Loudred, *Aron, *Makuhita, *Sableye, Abra, *Mawile, Geodude. Level 9-12.
Notice the Loudred. Whismur, it's lowest evolutionary stage, CAN be obtained eventually, but it will take a long time -- you might prefer to just breed a Loudred.

From the start, go right and down into a dead end with a Rare Candy hidden in a rock.

Then go left. You'll find Steven at the end of the path. He will give you a hint, as well as TM110 (Steel Wing). This is important -- once you beat Brawly for good, Steven will leave and you'll lose your chance to get this TM!

Go up a bit to a cliff. Stand on the tile right to a pile of rocks and search the cliff. You'll find stairs.

Go right from the stairs all the way to the end to find an Everstone. Then go back left and down at the end to reach the exit to Route 106.

---------
ROUTE 106
---------
Weather forecast: Heavy rain
Fishing: *Corphish and *Carvanha.

Careful! The moment you'll exit the Granite Cave, you'll get ambushed by Brock. Beat him.

Go north to a house and talk to the old man in front of it. He'll give you a Mudkip.

Go west into the trees. You'll appear in a separate part of Route 106 where you can fight Brawly and defeat him for good. He will give you the Knuckle Badge and TM52 (Focus Blast).
(Note that you can't catch anything when fishing on this screen).

Now that you defeated Brawly, the Hoenn teleport system will connect to Dewford Town. In addition, Mr. Briney's ship will now take you to a new location: Route 109.

---------
ROUTE 109
---------
Fishing: Wingull and Tentacool.

Once you go up, you'll get into a battle with a trainer. Then go up and left -- in the NW corner of SW step-like shore is a hidden Heart Scale.

Go up. Under the middle of the closest shelter is a Revive.

Go right and fight a second trainer. NE from the trainer, in a corner of a beach, is another hidden Heart Scale.

Go a bit up, then left and check the middle of another shelter for a PP Up.

At the top of the beach is a bigger yellow shelter with a trainer. Fight him, then talk to him for a Fresh Water (he will sell them afterwards). Also check both pedestals by this shack! The left one contains a Soft Sand, while the right one has a Big Pearl.

Go right and fight the fourth and last trainer. That's all that can be done here; continue north to Slateport City.

--------------
SLATEPORT CITY
--------------

On the left side is a MARKET. It has to be written in all caps, since it's a really great MARKET selling lots of strange items.

There's 7 vendors here altogether.

Top left stall, left vendor:
DeepSeaScale - 200
DeepSeaTooth - 200
Dragon Scale - 2100
Dubious Disc - 2100

Sitrus Berry - 800

So, there's finally an Incense shop that won't stop working, but the most interesting shops are definitely Poke Ball shop and Evolution shop. This is a good time to mention what do you need them for. Lots of evolutions in main games works by trading, but here you just need to give the item to a Pokemon and then level it up. You also must do this at the right time.

During the DAY:
DeepSeaScale: Evolves Clamperl into Gorebyss.
King's Rock: Evolves Poliwhirl into Politoed.
King's Rock: Evolves Slowpoke into Slowking.
Magmarizer: Evolves Magmar into Magmortar.
Metal Coat: Evolves Onix into Steelix.
Prism Scale: Evolves Feebas into Milotic.
Protector: Evolves Rhydon into Rhyperior.
Sachet: Evolves Spritzee into Aromatisse
Whipped Dream: Evolves Swirlix into Slurpuff.
Oval Stone: Evolves Happiny into Chansey.

During the NIGHT:
DeepSeaTooth: Evolves Clamperl into Huntail.
Dragon Scale: Evolves Seadra into Kingdra.
Dubious Disc: Evolves Porygon2 into Porygon-Z.

Reaper Cloth: Evolves Duskclops into Dusknoir.
Up-Grade: Evolves Porygon into Porygon2.
Razor Claw: Evolves Sneasel into Weavile.
Razor Fang: Evolves Gligar into Gliscore.

Either buy them in advance, or return here when you want to evolve one of these Pokemon.

Now for the Poke Balls. The important stat for a Poke Ball is its "catch rate", which (I simplify) states how much better it is than standard Poke Ball. At this point, our basic type is Ultra Ball with catch rate of 2.

Level Ball: If your Pokemon is at the higher level than the opponent, Level Ball is already as good as an Ultra Ball. If you surpass double opponent's level, it has catch rate 4, and if you surpass quadruple opponent's level, it has catch rate 8. Actually, if you have some highly levelled Pokemon (and you should have, seeing as you already worked your way through two games' full of content and seeing as the wild Pokemon levels reset in each region), Level Ball should actually become your standard Poke Ball. It will always be at least as good as an Ultra Ball (unless you're trying to catch something that has higher level than you), but it's actually four times cheaper! Just remember that you should send a high-leveled Pokemon out before you use it.

Lure Ball: The exact catch rate of a Lure Ball differs between main games and I'm not sure how much it is here, but should be either 3 or 5 -- both better than Ultra Ball. However, there's a catch: it only has this improved rate while fishing.

Moon Ball: Has catch rate 4 if you use it on a Pokemon from family that evolves with Moon Stone, that is Nidoran (both genders), Clefairy, Jigglypuff, Skitty, Munna and their relatives. This is pretty niche, seeing that at this point you are probably only missing Skitty and Munna, and even for them, Level Ball might be as good or better.

Friend Ball: Has catch rate of 1 (like standard Poke Ball) but comes with an extra effect: improved happiness for Pokemon who is caught by it. Which saves some time, at most. Not a priority.

Love Ball: Has catch rate of 8 -- but only if you use it on something the same species and opposite gender as your Pokemon. Which is not really something you'd do often. Perhaps you could use it in conjunction with the Cute Charm ability (which improves a chance of meeting opposite-gender Pokemon) if you want to obtain a rare gender of some species.

Heavy Ball: Instead of having a flat catch rate, it gives additive bonuses based on opponent's weight. Could be useful for some heavy Legendaries, as well as Rock and Steel Pokemon in general.

Fast Ball: Has catch rate of 4 if you want to catch a very fast Pokemon (base Speed stat 100 or higher). You don't need Fast Balls for normal Pokemon, but some Legendaries have high Speed and Fast Balls might be a good choice for them. I'll let you know when you meet them.

Repeat Ball - Has catch rate of 3 (or possibly 3.5) if the Pokemon is already registered in your Pokedex as caught. If you are just trying to fill the Pokedex, you won't find much use here.

Timer Ball - This is an interesting one: it improves its catch rate with time. It starts on 1 and improves roughly by 0.30 per turn. On the 5th turn, it's already better than Ultra Ball. If you let the battle go for 11 turns, Timer Ball will reach catch rate of 4 and it will be twice as good as Ultra Ball. Buy a lot of Timer Balls -- they will be our main ammunition against Legendaries from now on. Just remember that if you have something with better than double level of the Legendary, Level Ball will still be better.

Nest Ball: This one works better on low-leveled Pokemon. The problem is that it won't have any special effects on Pokemon of level 30 or higher, and against anything weaker, you should have something with high enough level to reach catch rate 4 with Level Ball (Nest Ball will always have worse catch rate than 4, unless you actually find a level 1 opponent). Don't bother with Nest Balls -- Level Balls are superior AND cheaper!

Net Ball: This is basically a variant of Lure Ball. Catch rate is 3 (or maybe 3.5?) against all Water types, and ALSO against Bug types. It's more versatile than Lure Ball, but more expensive.

Dive Ball: Has catch rate 3.5 against water-dwelling Pokemon. Considering that this game doesn't have Surf or Dive, it's basically an expensive Lure Ball.

Luxury Ball: Alternative to Friend Ball; while Friend Ball improves the initial happiness of the Pokemon, Luxury Ball increases the rate it grows. All in all, neither seems too good, but Friend Ball gives you the benefits right away AND is cheaper so avoid Luxury Ball unless you want to give your Pokemon some bling.

Heal Ball: Has catch rate of 1 and heals caught Pokemon. This is basically useless. The only use would be if you wanted to use the captured Pokemon right away without sending it to the PC, and let's be honest -- with what you probably have right now, when would you do THAT?

Quick Ball: Has catch rate of 5 -- but works only on the first turn of a battle. There's probably no harm in maintaining a supply of these. Throw one whenever you encounter a new Pokemon, and if it won't work (not even the high catch rate will help much if the Pokemon is not weakened at all), just switch to other types.

Dusk Ball: Has catch rate of 3.5 (or possibly just 3?) in a cave area, or at night.

So, my recommendations are:

1. Grab some Quick Balls, but don't go overboard.
2. Buy lots of Level Balls and use them as your default Poke Balls from now on.
3. Buy lots of Timer Balls and use them to catch Legendary Pokemon. Buy Fast Balls for fast Legendary Pokemon and Heavy Balls for heavy Legendaries (those should help a ton).
4. Get some Lure Balls and Dusk Balls, MAYBE some Net Balls. You can use those when their conditions are met, but if your Pokemon has more than twice the level of target, Level Balls will STILL be better.
5. Ignore the rest, or use them as novelty.

Once we're done with the MARKET, go up past the Poke Mart. A house on the left has another Name Rater. The way north is blocked by a guy who wants us to support his girlfriend in a Pokemon Contest, so go there (it's the house in the NW corner of the city). You'll end up in another battle with May. There's also a Move Tutor for Magic Room in here.

Now go north to Route 110.

---------
ROUTE 110
---------
Wild Pokemon: Oddish, Zigzagoon, *Plusle, Poochyena, Wingull, *Electrike, *Minun, *Gulpin. Level 12-14.
Fishing: Tentacool and Magikarp.

This is an extremely long, but linear path.

First of all, go north until you come to a house. There's a guy in front of it who will give you a quiz. The correct answers are:
1. Muk
2. Yellow
3. Illumise

When you get all three correct, he'll give you a Good Rod!

GOOD ROD UPDATE

OK, now that you have a Good Rod, you can catch lots of new Pokemon even in older areas, right? Right?

Well, not exactly. Most fishing areas you have encountered until now have Good Rod catching the same two Pokemon as the Old Rod, with the only difference being that Old Rod has 7:3 chance of Common vs. Uncommon catch while Good Rod has 8:2 (so if you want the uncommon type, Old Rod is actually better!). Only a handful of areas has something new.

Pallet Town: Good Rod allows you to catch Tangela, Goldeen or Poliwag.
Safari Zone Kanto: Good Rod allows you to catch Seadra, Dragonair and Tentacruel.
Safari Zone Johto: Good Rod allows you to catch Quagsire, Lanturn or *Mantine.
Blackthorn City: Good Rod allows you to catch Horsea and Poliwag instead of Magikarp and Poliwag.
Route 110 (where you are now): Good Rod allows you to catch *Wailmer and Tentacool.

And that's all -- all other areas have nothing new compared to Old Rod. So grab a Mantine and a Wailmer. Remember that Mantine can be bred with Wave Incense to obtain Mantyke. In order to evolve Mantyke, you need to have a Remoraid in your party, so if you already evolved it into Octillery, you'll need to get another one.

END OF GOOD ROD UPDATE

So, anyway, continuing along Route 110, you'll encounter many trainers. Close to second trainer is a visible Revive. Then hug the southern edge of the path. In the second gap in the grass is a hidden Revive. Two more trainers, then another hidden item (a Great Ball). It's tricky to find: near the top of the grass patch is a 4x4 square that is nearly complete (missing the lower left corner and 3-square path from the lower right corner). The Great Ball is hidden on the second tile of this "path".

The final part of the Route has two trainers and a flower patch with two visible items: a Heal Ball and a Rare Candy.

Continue north into Mauville City.

-------------
MAUVILLE CITY
-------------

Right at the entrance, there is a house with green flowers next to it. Search the rightmost flower for an X Speed. The woman inside the house will give you TM68 (Giga Impact).

There's a Game Corner, but apart from the layout, it has the same stuff as the others.

In the Gym, there are two trainers and Wattson. Beat him for the Dynamo Badge and TM73 (Thunder Wave). This will upgrade Teleport system in Hoenn again.

Go north to Route 111.

---------
ROUTE 111
---------
Wild Pokemon: *Volbeat, *Illumise, Weepinbell, *Skitty, Pidgeotto, Oddish. Level 16-18.
Fishing (Old Rod): Goldeen and Magikarp.
Fishing (Good Rod): Surskit and *Barboach.

Start by fighting two trainers (can be fought together). Go up stairs and then left through the grass patch until you reach a boulder with a hidden Revive.

Go up the next set of stairs. Fight a trainer, go past him and grab a Stardust.

Continue to a house and grab a HP Up next to it. The house itself has five trainers - beat them all for a Macho Brace.

Then you'll come to a crossroads. North is another part of Route 111 with three more trainers. There's also a house with a healer. Right from the house is a grass patch with a single tree. Search the left tile below the tree for a Protein.

There are three possible exits from Route 111. First go right into the trees to reach the Mirage Kingdom.

--------------
MIRAGE KINGDOM
--------------

Misty is here and you can fight her again. There's also an old man who will give you a Togepi. That's all you can do here.

The way west leads to Route 112. However, you can't progress there at the moment. The only remaining exit is the NW corner of Route 111 and leads to Route 113.

---------
ROUTE 113
---------
Weather forecast: Sometimes sandstorm
Wild Pokemon: *Trapinch, Sandshrew, *Skarmory, *Spinda, Cacnea, Geodude. Level 14-16.

Go left and fight two trainers. A pile of rocks north of the second trainer contains a hidden Ether. Go up and jump the ledge to the right. A pile of rocks on this ledge contains a Nugget. Jump down again and continue left.

Past the second trainer, go left and down this time to find a visible Super Repel. Third trainer follows. Go around the big rock on the north to fight a fourth trainer.

Go left and a guy on the upper level will give you TM32 (Double Team). Jump down and fight the last trainer. Continue west to Fallabor Town.

-------------
FALLABOR TOWN
-------------

The Contest Hall (the middle building in the upper row) has some flowers in front of it; the left patch hides a Nugget.

The left house in the upper row has a Move Maniac. The SW house has a Move Tutor for Rollout.

Enter the Contest Hall for another brush with Team Rocket. After you beat them, the old guy there is a Move Tutor for Pain Split.

Talk to the guy in the middle of the Contest Hall and he'll ask the guard to let you pass through Fiery Path (note that you must also beat Misty in the Mirage Kingdom, otherwise he won't let you through).

----------
FIERY PATH
----------
Wild Pokemon: *Slugma, Grimer, Koffing, *Numel, *Torkoal. Level 16-18.

A simple linear path with nothing of interest, apart from the wild Pokemon. If you haven't bread Magcargo, this is your chance to get a Slugma.
Exit south to Lavaridge Town.

--------------
LAVARIDGE TOWN
--------------

A guy near the Gym will fight you.

There's a Hoenn branch of the Day Care in this town.

The guy between Poke Center and Poke Mart will give you a Wynaut egg. Well... why not?

A guy in Poke Center will sell Moo Moo Milk.

The house on the right has a trader who will exchange his Feebas for your Magikarp.

The gym has two levels. There are holes on the upper level and ladders on the lower level.

Go left and fight the first trainer. Drop down the hole, then go up the ladder on the left.
Go down the hole north of you to find the second trainer.

Jump down and go up the ladder again. This time, go down a hole in the upper left corner. Go up a ladder here, then up and left to another hole. Go up past the third trainer to the next ladder and fight the fourth trainer there.

Jump down the other hole in this room. Go up the ladder and fight the fifth trainer.

Go down the other hole, then up the ladder. Fight Flannery. You'll get the Heat Badge and TM50 (Overheat). Then take the right hole to get near the exit.

After beating Flannery, the Hoenn teleport system upgrades again. You will be also able to take the route 112 as a shortcut back to Route 111.

Go east to Route 112, as there are a few things to do.

---------
ROUTE 112
---------
Wild Pokemon: Spinda, Teddiursa, Gulpin, Shroomish, *Swablu, *Solrock, *Lunatone. Level 16-18.

There is a total of four trainers and two visible items: Guard Spec on the left and Nugget on the right. There's also a Big Mushroom hidden in a boulder behind the Guard Spec.

Enter the cave.

---------------
VALLEY OF STEEL
---------------
Wild Pokemon: Torkoal, Magnemite, Skarmory, Magneton, Steelix. Level 17-21.

A very small cave that contains only one item -- a Charcoal.

Return to Mauville Gym, where you can fight Wattson again. Then go to Petalburg City.

--------------
PETALBURG CITY
--------------

If you have beaten both Wattson and Flannery, the Petalburg Gym is now accessible.
After you beat May who waits in front of it, I mean.

The Gym has five trainers plus Norman. Beat him for Balance Badge and TM15 (Hyper Beam). He will also hint that the way east from Mauville City is now open. Go there and enter Route 118.

---------
ROUTE 118
---------
Wild Pokemon: Nuzleaf, Shroomish, Breloom, Voltorb, Oddish, Weepinbell, *Spoink, Vileplume. Level 21-24.
Fishing (Old Rod): Remoraid and *Feebas.
Fishing (Good Rod): Poliwrath, Whiscash and Carvanha.

Directly north of you is a Stardust.

There's eight trainers on this route, and two other items: a visible Leaf Stone in the eastern part and a hidden Iron. To get it, go north at the eastern edge of the beach, then west. Three boulders are close to the western edge of this platform; Iron is hidden in the middle one.

Continue north to Route 119.

---------
ROUTE 119
---------
Wild Pokemon: Dugtrio, Shroomish, *Shuppet, Breloom, Igglybuff, Vileplume, Oddish, *Castform (rare). Level 21-24.
Fishing (Old Rod): Remoraid and Feebas.
Fishing (Good Rod): Poliwrath, Whiscash and Gyarados.

Don't bother to try and catch a Castform -- there is a guaranteed free one on this Route.

This is a long route. First, you'll come to a big grass patch with two trainers and a visible Elixir. Then you get to a winding bridge (seriously, who builds a winding bridge???) with three more trainers. Past the bridge, go immediately left to the trees and check the empty tile north of you (in the corner) for a hidden Full Heal. Continue north past another trainer.

When you get to the fork, go right (the way north just leads to a bottom of a cliff). There will be a short bridge with a single trainer. Past the bridge, go down the stairs and left for another visible Elixir. Two trainers will ambush you as you continue north.

Past the big set of stairs, go right through the grass to grab the item (a Sun Stone). At the fork, go left, and then down to another trainer.

Go north to Weather Institute. A guy on the left will let you change the weather. Inside is a guy who will give you a Damp Rock, and one who will give you a free Castform.

Go out, then back right and up. Fight another trainer and grab a Rare Candy in the NW corner. Go right past the last trainer to Fortree City.

------------
FORTREE CITY
------------

A guy in the Pokemon Center offers you a Chimecho. It's actually Hoppip, but seeing that the only place with Hoppip had them quite rare, you might want to get it anyway.

The treehouse next to Poke Center has a sleeping guy who is the Move Tutor for Sleep Talk. The treehouse next to Poke Mart has a guy who will give you a Moon Stone.

Go right from this treehouse (the way right from the first one is blocked for now). Talk to the guy on the next platform for TM10 (Hidden Power). Moving along the path, you'll get to Brock.

Past Brock, you get to Winona. Talk to her and she'll go to her Gym. This will also open the way right from the treehouse next to Poke Center.

A guy in the treehouse at the end of the new path will trade your Pikachu for his Skitty.

The gym has a long winding path with four trainers and Winona. Beating Winona gives you the Feather Badge and TM58 (Sky Drop). Hoenn teleport system gets upgraded as well.

Continue east to Route 120.

---------
ROUTE 120
---------
Weather forecast: Slight chance of rain
Wild Pokemon: *Slakoth, *Chimecho, Gardevoir, Zigzagoon, Beedrill, Flaaffy, Volbeat, Swablu. Level 23-26.
Fishing (Old Rod): Remoraid and Feebas.
Fishing (Good Rod): Poliwhirl and Masquerain.

Note that Chimecho can be bred with Pure Incense to produce Chingling.

A long north-south route. Start by fighting the first two trainers. Then go right, fight a third trainer, and collect a Rare Candy at the end of the path.

Go south until you reach grassy path to the left. First patch of flowers south of this path hides a Zinc.

Continue south and then right for a visible Dusk Ball.

Go left across the bridge. Beat one trainer, then you'll encounter a guy who will give you a Nest Ball. Continue left and fight two double trainers (as always, they can be fought twice by talking to one and then the other).

Continue south. Beat another trainer and go right along the water edge to get another Rare Candy.

Go past next three trainers. In the corner of the cliffs, below a flower patch, is hidden another Nest Ball.

Fight the last two trainers. When you exit the grass patch, go left. In the upper right corner of a small alcove in the trees is a Full Restore.

Continue east to Route 121.

---------
ROUTE 121
---------
Wild Pokemon: Slakoth, Chimecho, Gardevoir, Zigzagoon, Beedrill, Flaaffy, Volbeat, Swablu. Level 23-26.
Fishing (Old Rod): *Clamperl and *Luvdisc.
Fishing (Good Rod): Mantine, Huntail and Wailmer.

Note the Luvdisc. Luvdiscs often have Heart Scale on them, and you can use those to pay the Move Relearners.

Right at the start, you will find a healer.

Go right, fight the first trainer. NE from you are twin trainers (these can only be fought once) and there is an Escape Rope hidden in a NE corner next to them.

When you get to stairs, go down and left. Fight another trainer and grab TM85 (Dream Eater) at the end.

Go right and fight another trainer in the grass patch. Go up stairs to a small platform with another trainer, and a Carbos hidden two tiles right and one tile up from the default position of that trainer.

The guy up the stairs from here is not actually a trainer.

Continue along the path. You'll encounter another trainer, then the path turns north. At the fork, go left, fight a trainer, and get a Shiny Stone at the end of the path.

Return past the previous trainer. The fence to the north is broken at one point. Go north through the hole until you reach the flower, then search the flower west of you for a Zinc.

Go south and fight two trainers. Then go down and left to fight the last trainer and grab a Max Revive at the end of the path.

That's all here, continue to the east to Lilycove City.

-------------
LILYCOVE CITY
-------------

A guy south from the entrance will give you TM71 (Stone Edge).

A guy in the Poke Center will give you a Focus Sash.

The Contest Hall has a Move Tutor for Magic Coat.

The rightmost house in the top row has a Stats Judge.

The house north of the beach has a Name Rater.

The beach has a lot of boulders on it; three of them contain items: the very left most one, the second rightmost one and the one almost directly SW from the second one. All three items are Heart Scales.

Alright, now that we found a store that sells all the evolution stones (except Ice Stone which isn't used until Gen 7), let's just have a quick run of which Pokemon need them so you'd know how many of each you should get.

The house next to the ship has a captain inside. Defeat him to get him to transport you to Mossdeep City.

-------------
MOSSDEEP CITY
-------------
Fishing (Old Rod): Tentacool and Wingull.
Fishing (Good Rod): Wailmer and Sharpedo.

Go north on the beach. You'll encounter a Move Tutor for DynamicPunch and find a Big Pearl at the end of the path.

On the tile left from Steven Stone's mailbox is a hidden Star Piece. Inside the house, Steven will give you a Beldum.

A guy on the plateau in the SE part of the island will give you a King's Rock.

The left house on the plateau in the NE part of the island contains two vendors. The left one sells:
Net Ball - 1000
Dive Ball - 1000
Lure Ball - 300

The right one sells:
Cheri Berry - 200
Chesto Berry - 200
Pecha Berry - 200
Rawst Berry - 200
Aspear Berry - 200
Oran Berry - 200
Lum Berry - 600
Sitrus Berry - 800

A guy blocking the door in the Space Center will give you a Sun Stone.

The gym in this City is full of teleporters, similar to Saffron City. This time, the rooms are not in any particular grid, so I'll just list them by letters:

Room A: Entry room. One trainer. Teleporter to Room B.

Room B: Three trainers. Teleporters to Room A (NE corner), Room C (SW corner) and Room D (SE corner).

Room C: Two trainers. NE Teleporter leads to Room B. The other two teleporters lead into each other.

Room D: Two trainers. SW teleporter leads to Room C. NE teleporter leads to Room E.

Room E: Tate and Liza. SW teleporter leads to Room E. SE teleporter is one-way teleport to Room A.

Beat Tate and Liza in a double battle for the Mind Badge and TM03 (Psyshock).

The next town is Sootopolis and if you ask around, you'll learn aboud a Psychic who can teleport you there. He's in the SE part of the island. Talk to him and get teleported to...

---------------------
IZABE ISLAND (PURIKA)
---------------------
Wait, what?

Fishing (Old Rod): Psyduck and Surskit.
Fishing (Good Rod): Surskit and Tentacruel.

In the top is a ferry back to Mossdeep City if you need to go back. To get back, use the Psychic again (though this time he will correctly identify your destination).

The Contest Hall has another Move Tutor, this time for Skill Swap.

Go to the forest. You'll have to fight another one of the Elite Four, Drake.

------------
IZABE FOREST
------------
Wild Pokemon: NidoranF, NidoranM, Ralts, Kirlia, Heracross, Tauros, Gardevoir, Poochyena. Level 27-32.

There's 8 trainers throughout this place, one Move Tutor (Bug Bite, south from the entrance), and 4 items:

An Ultra Ball east from the entrance (go around the trees).
A Full Heal in the NE corner of the forest.
A Poke Ball hidden in the southern part of the forest. It's in the top left tile of the big southern grass patch.
A Muscle Band at the end of the path east from the exit.

Continue south to another part of Izabe Island.

---------------------
IZABE ISLAND (RIYADO)
---------------------

In the left house, there's an old woman who will give you TM107 (Curse).

The right house has a trader who will trade your Magneton for his Togetic.

Go through the Gate House to Izabe Desert.

------------
IZABE DESERT
------------
Weather forecast: Sandstorm
Wild Pokemon: Trapinch, Claydol, Rhydon, Camerupt, Phanpy, Donphan, Vibrava, *Baltoy. Level 27-32.

Permanent Sandstorm here, so try to take something that's immune to it. There's 8 guys in the desert, all trainers except one in the middle who gives you a Claw Fossil (for Anorith). Talk to him again to obtain a Root Fossil (for Lileep). Remember that the fossils can be revived either on Cinnabar Island or in Rustboro City. There are also three items: a Hard Stone in the very south, a second Hard Stone roughly in the middle, and a Muscle Band in the very north.

Enter the Izabe Cave in the eastern part of the desert.

----------
IZABE CAVE
----------
Wild Pokemon: *Snorunt, Zigzagoon, Mawile, *Absol, Girafarig, Azurill. Level 27-32.

Once you enter, you'll get into another battle with Team Rocket. Then go right to find a healer. The rest of this icy cave has nothing but three trainers and two items: NeverMeltIce and BrightPowder. Apart from a few ice puzzles, nothing major.

Note: The only puzzle that might present some difficulties is how to pass the second ice field. Do it like this:

1. Get the BrightPowder -- that is the easy part since most ways through the field can get you in this area.

2. Go to the left edge of this area, second tile from the bottom.

3. Go left, down, and right to end up at the correct exit.

At the end, get out to a third part of Izabe Island.

---------------------
IZABE ISLAND (CEROSI)
---------------------

Not much to do here. Talk to the sailor in the NE corner to be offered a ride -- you can go to Mossdeep, Izabe, or Sootopolis.

Talking to this sailor unlocks the ferry system around the Izabe Island. The right ship in Mossdeep City can now take you to Izabe Front (start of the island) or Izabe Back (here), and the ship at the start of the island can now take you here as well as back to Mossdeep City. Similarly, the "Izabe" choice on this ride will take you to the start of the island.

But we're going to press on and go to Sootopolis City!

---------------
SOOTOPOLIS CITY
---------------
Fishing (Old Rod): Tentacool and Wailmer.
Fishing (Good Rod): Surskit, Sharpedo and Tentacruel.

Go north and enter the first house after the Poke Mart. The two guys here will give you an Ether and an Elixir.

Go across the bay, past the Gym. Grab a Protein at the end of the path.

Nothing else can be done here at the moment, so hit the Gym.

This Gym is fairly open. It has six trainers plus Juan. You have to fight him twice, once in a double battle and once in a single battle -- and the battles are in a row. When you defeat him, you'll receive the Rain Badge and TM96 (Bubble Beam).

Go to the Poke Center. You'll learn that May wants you to come to Pacifidlog Town.

Beating Yuan will unlock a new teleport upgrade. Also, if you go to Fallabor Town, you will find Jirachi next to the Contest Hall! Catch it!

Note that Jirachi has a base Speed of 100, meaning that Fast Ball has a bonus against it. However, don't use Heavy Balls -- despite Jirachi being a Steel type, it's actually very light.

Also note that you might need multiple attempts. You can't just throw Jirachi to 1 HP using False Swipe -- it has Double-Edge and can accidentally KO itself.

Take the ship from Sootopolis City to Pacifidlog Town (note that you must get the scene in the Poke Center first).

---------------
PACIFIDLOG TOWN
---------------
Fishing (Old Rod): Tentacool and Wailmer.
Fishing (Good Rod): Surskit, Sharpedo and Tentacruel.

This town is built on a bunch of wooden platforms in water for whatever reason.

The middle house in the bottom row has a guy who will give you a Heart Scale.

Go to the Contest Hall. There's a Move Tutor again (this one teaches After You), and May. Fight her. Once you beat her, the ship will take you to a new location: Ever Grande Conference.

----------------------
EVER GRANDE CONFERENCE
----------------------
This small island has basically five "lumps" with various features.

SE lump: This is where you start. You can sail back from here.

Central area: Two shops here.

On the left:
Cheri Berry - 200
Chesto Berry - 200
Pecha Berry - 200
Rawst Berry - 200
Aspear Berry - 200
Oran Berry - 200
Lum Berry - 600
Sitrus Berry - 800

On the right (Team Rocket):
Cleanse Tag - 200
Destiny Knot - 200
Everstone - 200
Poke Doll - 1000
Heart Scale - 9000

SW lump: Grass.
Wild Pokemon: Linoone, Crobat, Donphan, Wingull, Oddish, Misdreavus, Hoothoot, Wynaut, Shelgon, Sudowoodo, Vibrava, Jynx. Level 35-38.

The Pokemon here are mainly EXP fodder. We haven't found Shelgon's line yet, but there will be catchable Bagons soon.

NE lump: Incense shop.
Full Incense - 9600
Lax Incense - 9600
Luck Incense - 9600
Odd Incense - 9600
Pure Incense - 9600
Rock Incense - 9600
Rose Incense - 9600
Sea Incense - 9600
Wave Incense - 9600

North lump: Drink shop.
Fresh Water - 200
Soda Pop - 300
Lemonade - 350
Berry Juice - 100

NE lump: Pokemon League.

First, fight Brock who's waiting here. Then enter the building.

At this point, this should be familiar. The guy on the left is a Poke Mart, the girl left from the entrance will register you for the league, there's a Poke Center in the top right corner, yadda yadda yadda.

You start with the Elimination (leftmost exit). Then continue with three Double Battles (second exit from the left x3), Top 32 (middle exit), Top 16 (second exit from the right), and Top 8 (rightmost exit).

Alright, so we've got to Top 8 (where, once again, we're stopping). When you go out, one of Professor Oak's assistants meets you and asks you to go see the Professor. The ship in Ever Grande Conference will now take you straight to Littleroot Town, so you can just teleport to Pallet Town and go visit him. He will tell you that Battle Frontier opened in Kanto. So, the third generation is not over yet -- we still have to deal with this before we get to Sinnoh!

But before we start with Battle Frontier, some new Legendary Pokemon can now be obtained!

First of all, go to Route 121 (west of Lilycove City). Go west until you find the fishing platform (if you were catching Clamperl/Luvdisc here, you know where it is). Latias and Latios are now on this platform and you can fight them and catch them.

Both Latias and Latios are fast, so Fast Balls are preferable. They are troublesome because they both know Recover (so it's hard to keep them at low HP) and Psycho Shift (so they can pass status problems to your Pokemon instead).

Now go to Sootopolis City. New stairs appeared in the city that allow you to access a platform with a cave.

--------------
CAVE OF ORIGIN
--------------

Three main legendaries of Gen 3 are here: Kyogre, Groudon and Rayquaza.

All three are pretty heavy so you'll get bonuses from using Heavy Balls - Rayquaza has the smallest bonus, Kyogre medium one and Groudon has the highest. However, their base Speed is under 100 for all three so Fast Balls won't work well here.

Note that all three can heal -- Kyogre has just Aqua Ring, but Groudon and Rayquaza have Rest.

With 5 new Legendaries in your possession, go to Viridian City.

-------------
VIRIDIAN CITY
-------------

Surprise! The Gym that got destroyed is now standing again! You can now fight Agatha from the Elite Four who stands in front of it.

You can also visit the Contest Hall in Saffron City now (it was blocked previously). Like in the others, there's a Move Tutor -- this one teaches Zen Headbutt.

Go to Cerulean City.

-------------
CERULEAN CITY
-------------

Get a rematch with Misty in the Gym. Then go west to Route 4. You might remember that there was an item here that you couldn't get before, but now part of the fence disappeared and you can grab a Life Orb.

Go a bit wast from the fence. There is a path to the north. Take it to get to the Battle Factory.

--------------
BATTLE FACTORY
--------------
Wild Pokemon: Growlithe, Beedrill, Graveler, Golem, Geodude, Arcanine, Onix, Jigglypuff, Cleffa. Level 35-38.

First you have to pass through a winding path with four trainers. Then you get to an area with a vendor and TM106 (Bullet Punch).

The vendor sells:
Fresh Water - 200
Soda Pop - 300
Lemonade - 350
Berry Juice - 100
Max Potion - 2500
Full Restore - 3000
Revive - 1500

Liza, the Charizard girl is here again to act as a Day Care point.

Enter the building.

Inside looks like a smaller version of the various Pokemon Leagues -- you have a Poke Mart and a Poke Center in there, and a guy who lets you in to fight.

Note that despite what people here say, you don't get any rental Pokemon -- you fight Noland with your normal team.

Go to Saffron City.

------------
SAFFRON CITY
------------

First of all, do you remember the Fighting Dojo? It was the previous Gym in Saffron City (before Sabrina came). Now that you've beaten Noland, it's finally open! It contains 5 trainers. The last one will give you TM94 (Rock Smash).

Here's a fairly useless trick: Go to Pewter City and east to Route 3. Next to Mt Moon entrance is a rock that can be broken with Rock Smash. There is an Ultra Ball hidden in the wall behind it.

Anyway, back in Saffron City, go through the SW exit. You will fight May, then continue to Battle Arena.

------------
BATTLE ARENA
------------

Go all the way around the Arena to get a Black Belt in the NW corner. Then go inside and fight the four trainers there. Then go through the door to fight Greta.

Beating Great unlocks two new places -- the southern exit from Lavender Town, and the eastern exit from Fuchsia City. They form a big loop -- let's go for it from the Lavender side.

There's a Move Tutor for Volt Tackle in the gate building. Go south to Route 12.

--------
ROUTE 12
--------
Fishing (Old Rod): Magikarp and Wailmer.
Fishing (Good Rod): Gyarados, Goldeen and Tentacruel.

Go south and after first set of stairs, go left. In the upper left and lower left corners of this area are two hidden items: an Elixir and a Lure Ball.

Go south on the pier/bridge and beat the first trainer. Next guy you see will give you a Net Ball. Then you meet five more trainers (two are a double battle that can be fought twice).

Next is a small island with Pokemon Breeding Center. You can't pass because of all the eggs, so go inside for another battle with Team Rocket. Afterwards, you can accept several eggs. If you want to take them, remember that the Breeding Center has a PC. It has also two healers inside, for some reason.

So, there's a total of 8 eggs you can get (despite the claims that they will give you one as a gift, you can grab all eight). They are: Cleffa, Eevee, Igglybuff, Pichu, Magby, Makuhita, Smoochum and Vulpix. You probably don't NEED any of them (maybe except Eevee since you need a LOT of those to complete the Pokedex), but hey, they are free. You can try to make a Pokemon omelette.

The SW corner of the island (before the pier) has a hidden Iron.

Three more trainers and then you can leave to south to Route 13.

--------
ROUTE 13
--------
Wild Pokemon: Farfetch'd, Bellossom, Barboach, Dragonair, Surskit, Exeggutor, Azumarill, Vileplume, Machop, Shroomish. Level 35-38.
Fishing (Old Rod): Goldeen and Marill.
Fishing (Good Rod): Surskit, Barboach and Quagsire.

There's one trainer on the bridge and eight more on the land, in the maze of fences (two are double battle that can be fought twice). If you need healing, just enter the Battle Dome building -- there's a healer on the right side.

When you're done here, go to the Battle Dome and talk to the guy on top to fight Tucker. Beating him opens a new area in the Safari Zone, so let's go there -- by finishing this loop.

Go south from Route 13 to reach Route 14.

--------
ROUTE 14
--------
Wild Pokemon: Elekid, Seedot, Scyther, Nuzleaf, Exeggutor, Volbeat, Illumise, Kangaskhan, Linoone, Dugtrio. Level 35-39.

This is basically an open road with 8 trainers (two are a double battle that can be fought twice). In the NW corner, next to a cliff, is a hidden Zinc (it's on the tile you have to go through in order to reach the grass patch). In the SW corner, there's 5 Pinap Berries hidden in a flower (second flower from the left in the top row).

In the SE corner of this Route is Celebi! Fight and catch it. Celebi's Speed Stat is 100, so Fast Balls work on it. Actually, it shouldn't be that hard -- Celebi has much higher catch rate than most Legendaries.

Continue west to Route 15.

--------
ROUTE 15
--------
Wild Pokemon: Kangaskhan, Linoone, Elekid, Dugtrio, Seedot, Scyther, Nuzleaf, Exeggutor, Volbeat, Illumise. Level 35-39.

This Route is divided in upper and lower level -- you have to enter from Route 14 in a right way to get to the upper level.

The upper level has 4 trainers (two of them are a double battle) and a Rock Incense at the end. The lower level has another 4 trainers.

Continue west through a gate building to Fuchsia City. Let's hit the Safari Zone!

-----------
SAFARI ZONE
-----------

Go north to the lake, then west and north to the exit to Hoenn area of the Safari Zone.

Wild Pokemon: *Bagon, Gardevoir, Nuzleaf, Vigoroth, Beldum, Swablu, Vibrava, *Nosepass, *Tropius, Dusclops. Level 30-35.
Fishing (Old Rod): Surskit and Barboach.
Fishing (Good Rod): Lombre, *Spheal and Clamperl.

Four items here:
Calcium next to where you start.
A Rocky Helmet in the SW corner.
A Water Stone in the NW corner.
A hidden Nugget: roughly in the center of the area is a small lake that is just a horizontal line of water. Go west along its north shore. You'll hit a corner -- the Nugget is hidden in that corner.

Go to the NE corner, then west. Beat Brock and enter the Battle Pike.

The Battle Pike building has a healer in top left corner. It has five "paths", reached by talking to the five attendants on the top. The "correct" path is the second one from the right -- that leads to the boss. But you might want to explore the four other paths first -- they lead to two trainers and two items: a Sacred Ash and a Max Revive.


Note that leaving the area of Battle Pike will deposit you back in the entry gate of Safari Zone. Also, your Safari Game ends immediately when you enter the Battle Pike.

Now get to Cinnabar Island. A ship here will now have a new destination: Metallica Island.

----------------
METALLICA ISLAND
----------------
Wild Pokemon: Beedrill, Aron, Tropius, Rhyhorn, *Meditite, Smoochum, Girafarig, Rapidash, Nidoking, Ponyta. Level 38-41.
Fishing (Old Rod): Wingull and Surskit.
Fishing (Good Rod): Surskit and Pelipper.

Left of the Battle Palace are two trees that stand next to each other. Search the empty tile right of them for TM78 (Bulldoze). Then go to Battle Palace.

Battle Palace itself is very simple. Just a healer, a PC, and a way to fight Spenser.

Now go to Route 22 (west of Viridian City). You can now use the south exit to Route 26.

--------
ROUTE 26
--------
Wild Pokemon: Jynx, Butterfree, Ninetales, Snorunt, Loudred, Persian, Spinda, Mawile, Manectric, Growlithe, Venomoth, Spearow. Level 38-41.
Fishing (Old Rod): Lotad and Azurill.
Fishing (Good Rod): Gyarados, Marill and Lombre.

Basically, this is a long north-south route with Battle Tower at the south end. There are six trainers along the way, along with a few more goodies:

The first grass patch contains a visible Max Elixir.

The first house contains a healer.

There is a guy in the grass patch by the second house who will give you TM100 (Horn Leech).

While you won't get anything in the second house, the tile just south from the door hides a Rare Candy.

Battle Tower has a healer and a PC, as usual. There are two girls behind a counter. Talk to the left one to take the challenge, where you have to go through a hall and beat five trainers. Then talk to the right girl to take on Anabel.

Beating Anabel opens the last stage of Battle Frontier, but first go back on Route 26. There's an island in the lake and Deoxys appears on the island! Deoxys is fast, so Fast Balls are the preferable ammunition.

Then go to Pewter City and take the new exit west to Battle Pyramid.

--------------
BATTLE PYRAMID
--------------

Right after you enter the area, you'll be thrown into a battle against Brock.

Wild Pokemon: Miltank, Nuzleaf, Shroomish, Altaria, Seedot, Pidgeot, Salamence, Hoothoot, Mankey, Vigoroth, Slaking. Level 40-43.
Fishing (Old Rod): Azurill and Remoraid.
Fishing (Good Rod): Mantine, Ninetales and Gyarados.

There's a Wide Lens in the SE corner of the area.

The Battle Pyramid is a bit more complicated than the previous areas. You need to:

1. Fight Brandon who is NOT in the building, but outside (west from the stairs to the plateau).

2. Go inside (it has the usual amenities, healer, PC, plus even a Day Care). Talk to the guy at the top and fight Brandon again, "officially".

3. Go out. An Aipom will steal your Frontier Pass.

4. Go to Indigo Plateau. Aipom will be in the building. Beat it.

5. Go back to Battle Pyramid and fight Brandon for the third time.

After you do all this, Brandon will leave you Poke Balls with his Regirock, Regice and Registeel in Battle Pyramid. Another three Legendaries obtained, and this time without RNG!

Don't forget to heal -- you will have to fight May before you get back to Pewter City. Then go to Pallet Town, beat Gary who blocks your way to the lab, talk to Oak again and he'll open Gen 4 to you!

Go to Vermillion City. The left ship (the one you use to go to Hoenn) will now take you to Sinnoh.

---------
ROUTE 202
---------
Wild Pokemon: *Starly, *Chatot, *Budew, *Bidoof, *Buneary, Zigzagoon, Staravia. Level 2-5.
Fishing (Old Rod): Mantyke and Remoraid.
Fishing (Good Rod): Mantine and Bibarel.

New 4th Gen Pokemon start here! Budew is the 4th-gen pre-evolution of Roselia, a Pokemon we haven't found yet. Just bear in mind that you will need Rose Incense if you wish to breed more Budews and not just Roselias.

Start by going south to Sandgem Town.

------------
SANDGEM TOWN
------------

Go to the lab. You'll meet your new rival, Paul and fight him. The lab contains a teleporter that connects it to the teleporters in other regions. Grab the Piplup from the table.

Before going into the world, let's go west, to Route 201.

---------
ROUTE 201
---------
Wild Pokemon: Starly, Chatot, Budew, Bidoof, Buneary, Zigzagoon, Staravia. Level 2-5.

Nothing interesting here -- continue west and north to Lake Verity.

-----------
LAKE VERITY
-----------
Wild Pokemon: Starly, Chatot, Budew, Bidoof, Buneary, Zigzagoon, Staravia. Level 2-5.
Fishing (Old Rod): Mantyke and Remoraid.
Fishing (Good Rod): Mantine and Bibarel.

Grab TM19 (Telekinesis) in the NE corner. Nothing else to do here for now.

Go south from Route 201 to reach Twinleaf Town.

-------------
TWINLEAF TOWN
-------------
Fishing (Old Rod): Psyduck and Magikarp.
Fishing (Good Rod): Goldeen and Golduck.

I'm just mentioning this place for completeness, though we will return here in the future.

It's time to go on. Return to Sandgem Town and talk to Dawn in the NE corner. Defeat her and you can leave to a new section of Route 202.

---------
ROUTE 202
---------

There are three trainers. There is also a Turtwig who won't let you into the woods. Catch it. In the woods is a girl who will give you a Miracle Seed. Four flowers here also hold items:

Chesto Berry (top right flower in the group of 3 in the SW corner).
Sitrus Berry (the rightmost flower in the L-shaped patch close to SE corner).
Leppa Berry (the lone flower in the NE corner).
Lum Berry (the lone flower in the NW corner, NE from the house).

Go north to Jubilife City.

-------------
JUBILIFE CITY
-------------

Right from the start, go west aroud the plateau the city is on to get an X Attack at the end of the road.

The first house you come to has an old lady who will give you a Quick Claw.

Brock is in the western part of the city. Fight him. He'll give you a Sacred Ash.

The house NE of Brock is a school. There's a trainer there.

In the middle of the city is a park. Search the right tile below the tree there for a Stardust.

There are two new exits right now: north and east. Go east for now.

---------
ROUTE 203
---------
Wild Pokemon: Pidgey, Spearow, Seedot, Nuzleaf, Hoothoot, Natu, Taillow, Swablu, Swellow, Pidgeot, Shiftry, Vileplume. Level 4-7.
Fishing (Old Rod): Psyduck and Magikarp.
Fishing (Good Rod): Golduck and Seaking.

Once you enter, you'll get into a fight with Paul.

Go right and up. Beat the trainer and grab an item to the right (a Poke Ball).

Continue right and fight two other trainers. Then go up and left past another two trainers to get the item at the end of the path (a Repel). Go back right and enter the cave.

-------------
OREBURGH GATE
-------------
Wild Pokemon: Zubat, Psyduck, Geodude, Ursaring. Level 4-8.

This is a fairly small cave with just two trainers. There are two hidden items: a Moon Stone is in lone boulder at the point where a path branches off to the north. From there, go all the way south. Check a tile left of you (diagonally adjacent to two different rock piles) for a Big Pearl. Then go right, fight the first trainer, and grab the Earth Plate at the end.

Plate Collection: 1/17

Go right again, fight the second trainer and exit the cave into Oreburgh City.

-------------
OREBURGH CITY
-------------

This is a big place so let's do this systematically.

Top row of houses:
The left house has a girl who will trade your Machoke for her Kadabra.
The second house has a girl who will give you a Heal Ball if you have a Zubat in your party.
The house at the end of the row (a few positions south from the row) has a guy who will give you a Great Ball.

Go left past the gym. The man in the house there will give you a Dusk Ball.

The museum has another guy who will revive fossils for you.

Go south in the area in front of the mines. There are four items hidden in breakable rocks. I mean, in rocks that look like they could be breakable. They actually aren't.

1. The SW corner. Contains a Dire Hit.
2. South from a pillar on the western side of the area. Contains a Stardust.
3. A bit NW from the signpost. Contains a Pearl.
4. South of the house. Contains a Yellow Shard.

Enter the Oreburgh Mine to the south.

-------------
OREBURGH MINE
-------------
Wild Pokemon: Zubat, Geodude, Onix. Level 4-10.

Go down the ladder. This area has two trainers and two visible items: a Poke Ball and an Escape Rope. Talk to Roark to get him to go back to the Gym. You'll also get a Skull Fossil that can be revived into Cranidos.

Now go to the Gym. It has two trainers and Roark. Beat him for Coal Badge and TM39 (Rock Tomb).

Teleport system in Sinnoh gets upgraded now.

The way north from Oreburgh City (Route 207) is blocked by rocks (though you can still catch some new Pokemon there), so go back to Jubilife City and go up to Route 204.

---------
ROUTE 204
---------
Wild Pokemon: *Pachirisu, Paras, *Shinx, Budew, *Kricketot, Bidoof. Level 4-7.
Fishing (Old Rod): Feebas and Magikarp.
Fishing (Good Rod): Bidoof, Seaking and Golduck.

First of all, enter Route 204 as far to the east as possible (by going around the fence in Jubilife City). This will drop you into an enclosed area with a Parlyz Heal.

Then go along the normal path and fight a trainer. Go around the fence to the left and then all the way back to Jubilife City along this side of fence to grab a HP Up.

Go north and fight another trainer. Further north, you'll find a cave. This part is impassable if you come here before beating Roark, but it will be open now. Fight the last trainer next to the cave and enter.

------------
RAVAGED PATH
------------
Wild Pokemon: Bidoof, Steelix, Hitmontop, Zubat
Cave: (Bidoof 40%, Steelix 30%, Hitmontop 20%, Zubat 10%) L4-7

Very short cave path leading to northern part of Route 204.

---------
ROUTE 204
---------

There are four trainers in this part (two of them are a double battle), and two items: an Awakening directly north from the cave (though you'll have to go long way around to reach it) and a Sea Incense in a nook on the western side.

Continue north to Floaroma Town.

-------------
FLOAROMA TOWN
-------------

The Contest Hall has another battle against Dawn. There's also a Move Tutor for Recycle.

Go through NE exit to Floaroma Meadow and grab an Ultra Ball, a Leaf Stone and a Miracle Seed there.

The house in NE corner has a berry shop:
Cheri Berry - 200
Chesto Berry - 200
Pecha Berry - 200
Rawst Berry - 200
Aspear Berry - 200
Oran Berry - 200
Lum Berry - 600
Sitrus Berry - 800

The house in SE corner has a guy who will give you TM84 (Poison Jab).

Once you defeat Dawn, you can go through the eastern exit and reach Route 205.

---------
ROUTE 205
---------
Wild Pokemon: *Combee, Shinx, Bellsprout, Budew, Swinub, Bellossom, Skiploom, Sandshrew, Growlithe, Bidoof. Level 8-13.
Fishing (Old Rod): Goldeen and Quagsire.
Fishing (Good Rod): Whiscash and Wooper.

When catching a Combee, make sure you'll get a female! Only female Combees can evolve. The best way to ensure it is to have a male Pokemon with Cute Charm ability leading the party. The possible Pokemon with this ability that you can have at the moment are Clefairy line, Jigglypuff line, Skitty line, and maybe Sylveon or Lopunny if you've evolved one. All those Pokemon can have another ability and/or be female, so look through your collection to see what you have.

Right at the start, check a dirt patch to find 10 Oran Berries.

This is a big and fairly open route. You'll encounter 8 trainers as you make your way north. There are four visible items -- south to north, they are: an X Attack, a Heal Ball, a Poke Ball, and a Repel.

From the Repel, go north as far as you can, then one tile left and check the tile above you for an X Defend.

The house in the northern part of the route has a healer.

Since the path to the NE is blocked, go north to the Eterna Forest.

-------------
ETERNA FOREST
-------------
Wild Pokemon: Combee, *Burmy, Caterpie, Ledyba, Shroomish, Sunkern, Kakuna, Gloom, Vespiquen. Level 8-13.

Note Burmy. You might want more of those because it can evolve in several different ways: males evolve into Mothim (Bug/Flying), but females evolve into Wormadam whose type depends on the "cloak" your Burmy has -- fighting in grass will make it evolve into Bug/Grass, fighting in caves into Bug/Ground and fighting in cities into Bug/Steel.

Eevee will evolve into Leafeon if you level it up here.

Once you enter the forest, you'll get into another battle with Team Rocket.

Go north, fight a trainer and grab a Net Ball to the west.

From the start, go east, fight a trainer and grab the Insect Plate.

Plate Collection: 2/17

North of you is a group of 7 trees. Line yourself above the center of the top tree and go north as far as you can. Then turn around -- tile south of you has a hidden Ether.

Go through a winding path with another trainer. You'll end up in an area with four big clumps of trees. There are three trainers here, and the NW-most grass tile hides a Green Shard.

Fight two trainers in the NE corner to go further. One tile on a meadow in front of the next grass patch looks a bit different -- there's Honey hidden on that spot.

Fight another trainer, then go to the NW part of this area for a Soothe Bell. Finally, go east and fight Gardenia. East from her is the exit to another part of Route 205.

---------
ROUTE 205
---------

Go north and west along the narrow path to get to the other side of blocked exit in the previous part. There is TM95 (Snarl) there.

This area has a bridge with three trainers. South from the bridge is a X Sp.Def. In the north is another dirt patch with 10 Sitrus Berries.

Continue east to Eterna City.

-----------
ETERNA CITY
-----------

The path to the tower is blocked by three shrubs. Search the middle one for a Berry Juice.

There's a PP Up next to the Bike Shop.

The tall house has a Name Rater on Floor 2, as well as a guy who will give you a Leppa Berry (it doesn't matter how you answer his question). On the top floor is a trader who will trade your Buizel for his Chatot.

The eastern part of a town contains a shop that sells:
EnergyPowder - 500
Heal Powder - 450
Energy Root - 800
Revival Herb - 2800
Poke Ball - 200

North of the shop is a small plateau with a pillar. There's the Draco Plate there.

Plate Collection: 3/17

The Gym has just Gardenia -- but she wants you to beat her trainers first, so use the teleport, fight the three trainers there, and then fight Gardenia. She will give you the Forest Badge and TM86 (Grass Knot).

Sinnoh teleport system gets updated. Also, the roadblock on Route 205 gets cleared so you can move along it faster without going through Eterna Forest.

There are two possible ways to continue, east to Route 211 or south to Route 206. Go to Route 206 -- Route 211 will be quite some time later.

---------
ROUTE 206
---------
Wild Pokemon: Happiny, Furret, Mismagius, *Hippopotas, Onix, Electrike, Crobat, Graveler, Golem, *Shieldon (rare). Level 14-19.

This is your first chance to get a Happiny if you haven't bred a Chansey yet. Shieldon is rare here, but there will be a better place to get it later.

Route 206 has two parts: the cycling overpass and the road below. You start on the overpass. Go left and grab the PP Up. Fight the six trainers and leave at the south end.

On the lower level, go back north, as there is a few things you can grab. There's a Full Heal, and you can also get 10 Rawst Berries from the dirt patch.

Then continue south to Route 207.

---------
ROUTE 207
---------
Wild Pokemon: Golem, Shieldon, Mismagius, Happiny, Hippopotas, Onix, Electrike, Crobat, Graveler, Furret. Level 14-19.

Note: The Pokemon are the same as on Route 206, but their probabilities differ. In particular, Shieldon is MUCH easier to get here.

Also note that this route is an electric zone -- Magneton and Nosepass will evolve if you level them up here.

Also note that you need to beat Gardenia before you get here -- otherwise, the path will be blocked by rocks.

From the start, go west aroung the trees. You'll find a Great Ball hidden in the NW corner of this alcove.

Go east and south. Don't go down the stairs yet, though. Go further east. fight a trainer and search a boulder close to him for a Rare Candy.

Go up stairs and then west for another trainer and a Sun Stone. Then go east for another trainer.

Go north, down the stairs to your west and jump the ledge down. This area has another three trainers and a Revive.

Finally go down the stairs in the SW part and grab a Timer Ball at the NW corner of the area with the grass patch.

There are two exits from this route: you can go south to Oreburgh City, or you can talk to the guy with Abra by the cave to be teleported to Hearthome City.

--------------
HEARTHOME CITY
--------------

You start in front of the Poke Center. Start by going west and north around the fence until you can grab the Spooky Plate.

Plate Collection: 4/17

The lady in the house next to the PokeCenter will give you a Big Mushroom.

The house right from the Poke Mart is another Pokemon Fan Club and it has a Stats Judge. The house left from the Poke Mart has a girl who will give you TM104 (Air Slash).

The Contest Hall has a Move Tutor for Helping Hand.

Since the Gym is inaccessible and all ways out (including Poke Center teleport) are blocked, let's go to the big building -- the Battle Hall!

-----------
BATTLE HALL
-----------

Talk to the girl behind the counter to register. Then talk to Paul (if you forgot how he looks, he's the purple-haired guy on the left side). Talk to the attendant to go to the first match. The battles here are 2v2, and you always have an ally who sends out his own Pokemon.

There is a healer and a PC in the Battle Hall, so you don't have to go to Poke Center after every battle.

Talk to the attendant again for a second battle. Then leave the Battle Hall to see Paul kicking out his Chimchar. Take the Chimchar (notice that you need to have an empty spot in your active party).

Talk to Paul inside Battle Hall agian and go fight the third battle. And then the fourth. You will win a Soothe Bell (and Paul will give you his, so you'll get 2).

At this point, you can leave the city, although the south exit is still blocked. Western exit will teleport you back to Route 207, so go east to Route 209 instead.

---------
ROUTE 209
---------
Wild Pokemon: *Zangoose, *Spiritomb, Pidgeot, Raticate, Bagon, Bidoof, Nosepass, Metang, Rhydon, Magmar. Level 19-22.
Fishing (Old Rod): Magikarp and Goldeen.
Fishing (Good Rod): Bibarel and Gyarados.

Start by going north. In this area, fight a trainer and grab Honey.

Go over the bridge, fight another trainer and go north for a big dirt patch whose two tiles hide 10 Chesto Berries and 10 Razz Berries.

Go back to the second trainer. Right from there is a double trainer and another trainer on the pier.

Go south over the bridge and past the trees to get TM75 (Swords Dance). Then go back.

Dawn on the next bridge will offer trade her Buizel for your Aipom.

After Dawn's bridge, go to the NW corner of the next area. It hides a Super Potion.

Go past another trainer and turn west before going down the stairs into a depression. Go north in this area to grab a Calcium. Go back to the stairs.

North of the depression is a trainer. Go east to another trainer and a TinyMushroom hidden in the SE corner of this area.

Then there is one last double trainer and that's all for Route 209! Continue north to Solaceon Town.

-------------
SOLACEON TOWN
-------------

Right at the start go east to dirt patch with three sets of 10 berries: Persim, Nanab and Figy. Further east is a trader who will trade your Raichu for his Porygon-Z.

The Contest Hall has a Move Tutor for Heal Bell.

West from the Contest Hall is Sinnoh Day Care.

There's a Big Mushroom hidden in the lonely patch of flowers in the northern part of the city.

Eastern side of the town is a series of ledges. Go down the second ledge from the right to reach a PP Up. Then you'll reach a house with two traders -- one will trade your Electabuzz for his Magmortar, and the other will trade your Magmar for his Electivire.

Then go down the ledge at the eastern edge of the town. Reach the Solaceon Ruins.

--------------
SOLACEON RUINS
--------------
Wild Pokemon: Unown. Level 20.

You'll get into another Team Rocket battle once you enter the cave. Otherwise, there's nothing interesting here, so go back to the town and continue north to Route 210.

---------
ROUTE 210
---------
Wild Pokemon: *Drifloon, Luxray, Swinub, Ponyta, Abra, Miltank, Glaceon, Machoke, Psyduck, Muk, Beedrill. Level 19-25.
Fishing (Old Rod): Wooper and Psyduck.
Fishing (Good Rod): Psyduck, Wooper and Muk.

Right now, not all of Route 210 is accessible. The accessible part has 4 normal trainers and 2 pairs of double trainers. There are also a few items:

Rare Candy: hidden on the big plaetau, one tile south from the NW corner.
Super Repel and Great Ball: visible in the western part of the Route.
Heat Rock: the lady south of the house will give it to you.

The house has a vendor selling Moomoo Milk for 500.

Continue east to Route 215.

---------
ROUTE 215
---------
Weather forecast: High probability of rain
Wild Pokemon: *Gligar, Beautifly, Gliscor, Hippopotas, Butterfree, *Glameow, Hippowdon, Spearow, Pidgeot, *Cherubi (rare)

There will be better places to catch Cherubi soon, no need to do it here.

This place is a bit confusing, especially because of the bridges -- to accommodate the crossings into game engine, you teleport from one end of a bridge to another and walk normally underneath.

Despite the twists and turns, the path is fairly linear, at least at the beginning. Cross first bridge, fight two trainers, grab an Ether. Go up to the plateau, fight a trainer, cross a second bridge and then a third. Go down, fight a trainer and grab a Zinc in dead end to the east, then go south underneath the bridge for another trainer.

Go east, go up the plateau, cross a bridge for a Max Revive. Go back and walk underneath that bridge.

Continue north and east, and talk to the guy there for a Fist Plate.

Plate Collection: 5/17

Go east into grass to find a HP Up. South from that grass patch are stairs down that lead to a Protein.

Go west for another trainer. The western dead end has a Carbos. 

Go east, fight the last two trainers, and exit the Route to the east.

--------------
VEILSTONE CITY

Start by going north. Grab TM122 (Dark Pulse) in this area.

On the plateau with the Gym, enter the one house you can. Talk to the guy inside (Reggie). After the first talk, he becomes a move tutor for Brave Bird.

Once you talk to him, the guy blocking the Gym entrance disappears and Dawn appears in his place. Talk to her to get her to leave. you can now go inside.

The Gym has four trainers and Maylene. Beat her for the Cobble Badge and TM47 (Low Sweep). Sinnoh teleport system gets upgraded again.

Now leave Veilstone City through the southern gate and go to Route 214.

---------
ROUTE 214
---------
Wild Pokemon: Chansey, Unown, *Stunky, Munchlax, Dustox, Cherubi, Budew, Shinx. Level 19-25.
Fishing (Old Rod): *Nincada.
Fishing (Good Rod): *Buizel and Floatzel.

Go south and fight the first trainer. Go east and grab 3 Pomeg Berries and 3 Chesto Berries in the dirt patch.

Go south from the berries and keep to the eastern side of the fence to find a Rare Candy.

Continue south, fighting another 4 trainers. Then go to the grass on the west and go around the fence to find a Big Root.

Continue south to another trainer.

Go west and north. In the NW corner of this area (empty tile in a grass patch) hides a Heart Scale.

Go back south, then to the west. South of you, in the big grass patch, is a Magmarizer.

Go up on the plateau. This area of Route 214 has three more trainers and two visible items: a 
Razor Fang and a Red Shard.

Return all the way to the old man trainer and continue south to Valor Lakefront.

---------------
VALOR LAKEFRONT
---------------
Wild Pokemon: Chansey, Unown, Stunky, Munchlax, Dustox, Cherubi, Budew, Shinx. Level 19-25.

Continue south through a few more grass patches to reach the path leading into the woods. Go there and talk to Wallace (otherwise the people in the town will send you to find him anyway).

Fishing at Lake Valor:
Old Rod: Feebas and Nincada.
Good Rod: Buizel, Floatzel and Milotic.

Go out and continue south into the town.

The first building you see is the Seven Stars Restaurant which has 5 pairs of double trainers.

South of the restaurant is a guy who will give you a Sun Stone.

The house west from the restaurant has a healer.

In the corner south from the Contest Hall is a Big Mushroom.

Go to the Contest Hall. Wallace is there and he now serves as a Move Tutor for Aqua Tail. There's a PC (important since there's no formal Poke Center here). There's also May -- fight her. This will open the southern exit from the town. Exit to Route 213.

---------
ROUTE 213
---------
Wild Pokemon: Yanma, *Croagunk, Wingull, *Shellos, Chatot, Drapion. Level 20-26.
Fishing (Old Rod): Tentacool and Magikarp.
Fishing (Good Rod): Remoraid, Gyarados and Octillery.

Drapion is an evolved form of Skorupi -- you will be able to catch it later.

The first part of the Route has two trainers and a Pearl hidden in the SE corner of the beach. Talk to Paul who blocks your way and fight him.

Continue west. There's another Pearl hidden in the first boulder you come to.

Continue west along the beach. Fight a trainers. After the trainer, there will be another guy at the beach (just a normal fishing guy), then there will be a group of 3 boulders -- the SE one contains yet another Pearl. Go even further west and grab a Heart Scale hidden in the lone boulder by the rock face.

Go to the house. The tile in front of the door hides a Max Revive. Inside is Dr. Footprint who will tell you about the happiness of your Pokemon.

Note that if he judges a Pokemon as "super friendly", it means that happiness is at max. Such Pokemon are eligible to get a Footprint Ribbon from him, and if it evolves by happiness, it will definitely evolve upon leveling up.

If he says that a Pokemon is "quite friendly", it MIGHT be able to evolve (if it evolves by happiness). It's not guaranteed, but even if it can't evolve yet, it only has a short way to go.

From the house, continue east. Turn north at first boulder and search the next boulder you come to for another Heart Scale. Fight the trainer in the area, talk to the second guy for a Water Stone, then go east towards Valor Lakefront and north along the rock face to a HP Up in the NE corner.

Go west from there. First and third boulder you come to hide more Pearls. Exit the beach to the west. There's a Yellow Shard in this area and two dirt patches: the western one has 3 Iapapa Berries and 3 Rawst Berries, and the eastern one has 3 Aguav Berries and 3 Rawst Berries.

Continue west through a gate into Pastoria City.

-------------
PASTORIA CITY
-------------
Weather forecast: Slight chance of rain

Brock is next to the Poke Center. Fight him.

The guy in the house south from the Poke Center will give you TM48 (Round).

The house south from that has a Move Maniac.

A guy in the SW corner of the city will give you a Mystic Water. The house north of him has a girl who will give you a Yellow Scarf if you talk to her with a Pikachu in your leading slot.

The Gym starts blocked, but it will be unblocked after you beat Brock. It has 6 trainers plus Crasher Wake. Beat hium for the Fen Badge and TM97 (Aqua Jet).

Teleport system in Sinnoh gets upgraded now and we can explore some more places, but first of all, go to Fuchsia City -- it's time to go to a new part of Safari Zone! Leave Safari Zone Kanto through newly opened eastern exit.

------------------
SAFARI ZONE SINNOH

Plate Collection: 6/17

Return to Pastoria City and leave to the southwest. Welcome to Route 212.

---------
ROUTE 212
---------
Weather forecast: Slight chance of rain
Wild Pokemon: Ralts, Roselia, Buizel, Kricketune, Shellos, Croagunk, Staravia, Smeargle. Level 21-26.

Super Rod: (Marill 40%, Psyduck 40%, Octillery 15%, Gyarados 4%, Gastrodon 14%) L31-34

This is a pretty big Route. It connects Pastoria City and Hearthome City -- the entrance from Hearthome City is now open as well.

Fight the first trainer. After you beat him, he will trade your Jolteon for his Glaceon.

This area has four small pools. The center of the NE pool contains a hidden Dawn Stone.

Next part is a complicated pier maze with four trainers.

The western end of this maze has three exits. Go through the top exit to reach a Rare Candy. The other two exits lead to an area with three trainers and a Max Ether. To the west is another trainer and a Protein. An old man in the house there will give you 10 Max Repels.

From the ledge below where the Rare Candy was, continue west. You'll reach a trainer, then a grass patch with a hidden Heart Scale (2nd grass tile from top, 2nd from west). After a few more turns, you'll get to another trainer.

Next you'll encounter Gary. Fight him and he'll give you a Razor Fang. Continue north, around a lake.

Next part is a garden full of bushes. Start by going to the west and search a tile in a corner formed by bushes outside of garden. There's a Super Potion there. Then continue north and grab a Rose Incense.

Now let's have a look at the Pokemon Mansion. Enter the courtyard -- there's one normal trainer and a pair of double trainers. East from the mansion is an Iron. Enter the mansion.

---------------
POKEMON MANSION
---------------

Go west. There are three rooms here: the room on the left has a healer while the one on the right has a woman who will give you another Soothe Bell. The door in the middle of the mansion lead to Trophy Garden.

Wild Pokemon in the Trophy Garden: Pichu, Igglybuff, Cleffa, Azurill, Swinub, Bonsly, Porygon, *Mime Jr., Eevee. Level 15-18.

Note that if you want to breed your own Mime Jr., you will have to evolve it to Mr. Mime and then breed it with the help of Odd Incense.

Now go out and leave the courtyard. In the garden, there's a berry patch with 3 Lum Berries and 3 Custap Berries. Fight four trainers there. Next to the second old man trainer, there's a lone bush with a hidden Pearl. Go north and fight one last trainer here.

Continue north and enter Hearthome City. Go to the Gym -- it's now blocked by Dawn who will fight you and give you the Secret Potion. With this item, go to Route 210 (north of Solaceon City). With the Secret Potion, the Psyducks who block the way north let you pass.

-----------------------
ROUTE 210 (SECOND PART)
-----------------------
Wild Pokemon: Ursaring, Luxray, Machoke, Muk, Glaceon, Drapion, Tauros, Shellos, Gengar, Shiftry. Level 26-30.
Fishing (Old Rod): Wooper and Surskit.
Fishing (Good Rod): Wailmer, Staryu and Poliwrath.

This part of Route 210 is once again massive. In the initial grass patch, there are three trainers and three hidden items:

Full Heal: In the NW part of this area is a big block of trees. At the western edge of this block, there's a one-tile gap between a tree and the rock face. That's where the Full Heal is hidden.

Ultra Ball: In the SE part of the grass patch is a single lonely tile of normal ground. The Ultra Ball is hidden there.

Hyper Potion: East and north from this tile is a 2x2 square of empty tiles. The Hyper Potion is hidden in the NW corner of this square.

Go north from the first grass patch, collecting a Nest Ball and a Smoke Ball along the way. You'll reach the second grass patch. This area has three trainers and a Red Shard in the grass.

Continue west and fight a pair of double trainers. The path east leads to a house you can't enter yet, so go north and west instead. There is a linear path past three more trainers. When you go across the bridge to the vest, you will automatically meet Fantina and fight her. Afterwards, go north, up the stairs, and grab the Meadow Plate.

Plate Collection: 7/17

Continue west to Celestic Town.

-------------
CELESTIC TOWN
-------------
Fishing (Old Rod): Magikarp and Goldeen.
Fishing (Good Rod): Seaking, Staryu and Poliwrath.

After such a huge route, we get a tiny town.

First, grab an Eviolite in the middle of the town and Choice Specs SW from there.

The SW house has a healer.

The Contest Hall has a Move Tutor for String Shot and a PC.

Enter the cave (Celestic Ruins) for another battle against Team Rocket.

Go back to Route 210. You'll have to fight Paul. Then go east until you get to the pair of double trainers. Continue east to the house. Defeat the guy in front of it. This lets you enter and meet the Move Tutor for Draco Meteor.

Go to Hearthome City. There's yet ANOTHER person blocking the Gym -- Barry. Fight him.

Finally, you can enter the Gym! The Gym has five teleporters inside; the one leading to Fantina is the second from the left. Other four have regular trainers.

Defeat Fantina for the Relic Badge and TM101 (Confuse Ray).

Now go to Jubilife City. The west exit will be open. Go to Route 218.

---------
ROUTE 218
---------
Fishing (Old Rod): Finneon and Goldeen.
Fishing (Good Rod): Gyarados, Staryu and Poliwrath.

-------------
CANALAVE CITY
-------------
Fishing (Old Rod): Marill and Psyduck.
Fishing (Good Rod): Seaking, Staryu and Poliwrath.

This is a port city built around a bay -- there's western part and eastern part connected by a bridge.

Go around the town first. The second house you come to has a Move Deleter. The library (north of western part) contains an old guy who will give you a Pearl. Old Chateau (north of eastern part) has a book. Read it to be thrown into a battle with Rotom. Catch it.

Go south from the eastern part to reach a clearing with Cresselia and Darkrai. Catch them. Darkrai is fast, so Fast Ball is preferred, but Cresselia is not. Neither of them benefits from Heavy Ball.

The Gym has 6 trainers plus Byron. Beat him to get the Mine Badge and TM74 (Gyro Ball). You'll also get the Armor Fossil. It can be revived into Shieldon, though note that you might already have caught one.

Teleport system in Sinnoh gets upgraded and you can now take the ship from Canalave City or Route 218 to a new location: Iron Island.

-----------
IRON ISLAND
-----------

There's only one guy here. Fight him. After you beat him, he will give you a Riolu egg.

Now go to Eterna City and exit east to Route 211.

---------
ROUTE 211
---------
Wild Pokemon: Combee, Shinx, Nosepass, Magnemite, Budew, Swinub, Bellossom, Skiploom, Skarmory, Growlithe, Bidoof. Level 8-13.

We could technically go here sooner, but there was a rock slide that would prevent us from continuing. Now, though, it's gone, so we can go north to route 216.

---------
ROUTE 216
---------
Weather forecast: Snowy
Wild Pokemon: *Snover, Snorunt, Froslass, Mantyke, *Bronzor, Stunky, Skorupi, Shuckle, Zubat, Cloyster. Level 32-37.

After last few long, complicated Routes, it's nice to see one that is short and simple.

Go west past four trainers. You'll reach a house with a healer. Continue west for another trainer and a Full Restore. Then go east past another trainer, north, and you're done with this Route! Continue to Route 217.

---------
ROUTE 217
---------
Weather forecast: Blizzard
Wild Pokemon: Snover, Snorunt, Froslass, Mantyke, Bronzor, Stunky, Skorupi, Cloyster, Bronzor, Shuckle, Zubat. Level 32-37.

Same Pokemon like on Route 216, with just minor variations in rarity.

This is an especially cold area -- Eevee can evolve into Glaceon when leveled up here.

Route 217 is fairly open -- there's 9 trainers here, as well as three items: an Ultra Ball, a Max Revive, and an Iron. There's a house here. The guy inside will give you the Icicle Plate.

Plate Collection: 8/17

Continue north to Lake Acuity. There's nothing to do there now, so continue east to Snowpoint City.

--------------
SNOWPOINT CITY
--------------

This is a fairly small city with the Gym in the middle.

The guy close to the Poke Center will give you a Fire Stone.

The girls in the NW house are traders: one will trade her Electivire for your Magmar, and the other will trade her Magmortar for your Electabuzz. The NE house has a Move Maniac.

Go north and talk to Paul in front of the temple.

The Gym has ice, four normal trainers and Candice. Beat her for the Icicle Badge and TM14 (Blizzard). This will also activate the guy east from the Gym who will now become a Move Tutor for Ice Punch.

Once you've beat Candice and talked to Paul, go back to Lake Acuity. Paul will be there. Defeat him once again.

At this point, go to Twinleaf Town (Paul actually sends you to Valor Lakefront, but if you try to go east from there, you'll be told to go to Twinleaf Town). You will find Barry and Palmer there. Defeat them. Once you defeat Palmer, he will give you TM23 (Smack Down). Now you can go to Valor Lakefront and fight Bertha from Elite Four who now guards the path east. Beat her and you'll be finally allowed to go east to Route 222.

---------
ROUTE 222
---------
Wild Pokemon: Gible, Zubat, Onix, Diglett, Trapinch, Teddiursa, Raichu, Murkrow, Magnezone, Metagross. Level 39-42.
Fishing (Old Rod): Krabby and Corphish.
Fishing (Good Rod): Sharpedo, Octillery and Poliwhirl.

Right at the beginning, go north into the grass and then the second path west. You'll end up back in Valor Lakefront and you can grab a Shiny Stone there.

Fight the trainer next to the grass patch.

Now you have two possible paths: the upper path, or the lower path across the beach. Let's start with the upper path.

First of all, there's a dirt patch with 3 Wiki Berries, 3 Mago Berries, 3 Aguav Berries, and 3 Qualot Berries. Then don't take the stairs but walk south of them. There's a Carbos in the dead end.

Return to the stairs and fight a trainer. Continue east. Enter the grass and walk east and south to the end of the path for a Big Mushroom.

Return to the stairs and take them. Fight four trainers on this path.

At this point, the upper path and the beach path merge, so go west and check the beach.

There are two houses. The right one has McCann who functions as a Day Care, while the left one has a guy who will give you three Nest Balls.

There are five trainers on the beach (plus one normal guy). There are also four hidden items:

1. From the door of the right house, go all the way south to the sea, then two steps to the north and check the tile east of you for a Heart Scale.
2. From the position below the NE rock, in the middle, go three steps west and check the tile south of you for a Full Restore.
3. Go in the same middle position below the middle rock, take two steps south and check the tile south of you for another Full Restore.
4. Go in the middle position below the western rock. Take one step south and check the tile west of you for another Heart Scale.

Exit the beach and go east to the gate that leads out of this route. You'll have to defeat Barry again in order to get there.

---------------
SUNNYSHORE CITY
---------------
Fishing (Old Rod): Krabby and Corphish.
Fishing (Good Rod): Octillery, Politoed and Lanturn.

The green Poke Mart clone is a Stone Shop. It has two clerks. The upper one sells:
Fire Stone - 2100
Water Stone - 2100
Thunderstone - 2100
Leaf Stone - 2100
Moon Stone - 4000

The bottom one sells:
Sun Stone - 3000
Shiny Stone - 2500
Dusk Stone - 2500
Dawn Stone - 2500
Ice Stone - 2100

This is the first place where you can get an Ice Stone, but it will still be a long time before you'll need it.

Apart from this shop, the only thing that you can do here right now is to go to the SE corner to the Sunnyshore Tower. The tile south from its sign has a hidden Zap Plate. There's also a visible Thunderstone, but you'll have to go around to get it -- and by that I mean that you'll have to go to the NE corner of the city and follow the narrow path along the eastern edge.

Plate Collection: 9/17

Talk to Flint (the red-haired guy in front of the tower) and fight him. This will allow you to enter the Gym. The Gym has six trainers plus Volkner. Unfortunately, your battle with Volkner gets interrupted by someone messing with the tower. It's Team Rocket (who else?). Go to the tower and fight them, then collect a Life Orb there. Go back to Volkner and fight him again. This will grant you the Beacon Badge and TM93 (Wild Charge).

Alright, so that's all Sinnoh gyms done, the Sinnoh teleport system is complete, and we can continue to the League -- but before that, there's a whole lot of smaller things to do.

1. Dawn appears in the eastern part of the town. Fight her.
2. The guy with a Skarmory close to the tower will now offer to fly you to the three lakes (Lake Verity, Lake Valor and Lake Acuity). You'll always end up on an island with the cave where you can find a Legendary Pokemon: Lake Verity has Mesprit, Lake Valor has Azelf and Lake Acuity has Uxie.
3. Go back to Route 222 and go to the beach. There's a sandbar you can get to, which now has Heatran and Shaymin.
4. Mt. Coronet opens -- go to Hearthome City and talk to the guy with Abra in the SW corner. You can find Dialga, Giratina and Palkia there. This is also one of the places where you can evolve Magneton and Nosepass. There are no random battles, so you'd have to level them up using a Rare Candy unless you want to get EXP by killing one of the legendary dragons. (You don't.)
5. With Dialga and Palkia in your party, go to Celestic Town and talk to the people in the Historic Center. One will give you the Lustrous Orb for Palkia, and one will give you the Adamant Orb for Dialga (you have to put the specific Pokemon in your front slot).

As for recommended Pokeballs, you should use Fast Balls for Azelf and Shaymin and Heavy Balls for Heatran, Dialga and Giratina. Palkia is both fast AND heavy, but Heavy Balls are probably better. Mesprit and Uxie will be probably best dealt with with Timer Balls.

With everything done and eight new Legendary Pokemon, go to Sunnyshore City and take the ship to the Lily of the Valley Island.

-------------------------
LILY OF THE VALLEY ISLAND
-------------------------
Wild Pokemon: Lunatone, Solrock, Claydol, Vileplume, Voltorb, Pineco, Onix, Golem, Mantine, Gloom. Level 35-38.

This island is formed from four smaller connected islands. You start at the SE island. The NE island has shops, and by now you should know what they are: Incenses, Berries, Drinks and Team Rocket shop. No real point saying what they sell since you probably have all those items you need and (except Team Rocket shop) they are all available elsewhere.

The SW island has wild Pokemon for training. The NW island has another battle against Brock and the League building.

The League building has the usual amenities -- Poke Center, Poke Mart, and McCann as a Day Care. Register in the SW corner.

First two battles are on the first exit from the left. The second exit from the left has the third round, the middle exit has the fourth round, and the second exit from the right has the fifth round (semi-finals). That's as far as you can get. As usual, once you leave the island, you're no longer allowed to come back.

Return back home to Pallet Town and talk to Professor Oak to start Gen 5!

But before we go to Unova, there are a few more Legendary Pokemon to get:

1. Go to Lake Verity (through Route 201, west from Sandgem Town) and fight Manaphy there. Remember that Phione can be obtained by breeding Manaphy with Ditto.
2. Go to Lake Valor and fight Arceus there. Take him in your party and give him various plates to register his different forms in the Pokedex.
3. Go to Snowpoint City and talk to Brandon by the Temple. He will give you Regigigas without a fight.

Manaphy should be caught with Fast Balls while Heavy Balls are good for Arceus.

Now go to Viridian City and take the blimp to a new destination -- Nuvema Town!

-----------
NUVEMA TOWN
-----------

Right after you arrive, there's a guy in the blimp waiting room who will give you TM01 (Hone Claws).

A guy in the town will give you another Exp. Share.

West from the lab is Zekrom just chilling and waiting to be caught.

The Lab has a healing machine, a PC, a Day Care guy, and a teleporter that connects to the labs in other regions (and to your house).

Go out of town to meet Trip and fight him. Continue north to Route 1.

-------
ROUTE 1
-------
Wild Pokemon: *Pidove, *Patrat, *Deerling, *Woobat, *Sandile. Level 2-4.

Second person you come to will give you a Potion. After that, you'll see an Oshawott. Talk to it, then go back to Professor Juniper. Go talk to her and she'll allow you to take the Oshawott. Then continue north, meet Iris (and fight her) and continue north to Accumula Town.

-------------
ACCUMULA TOWN
-------------

Nothing too important here except for a design change -- Unova has Poke Mart counters folded into Pokemon Centers.

The house in the NW corner has a guy who will give you a Poke Ball.

Go to the warehouse in the SW corner of the town for another battle with Team Rocket. After the battle, talk to the Tepig and take it with you. Now you can leave the town to the west and go to Route 2.

-------
ROUTE 2
-------
Wild Pokemon: Pidove, Patrat, Deerling, Woobat, Sandile. Level 2-4.

No new Pokemon here, the encounters are exactly the same as on Route 1.

Start by going west and grabbing a Poke Ball in the grass. Go east past a trainer, then into the next grass patch. There's a 2x3 rectangle of clear ground in this patch, with one extra clear tile attached; that extra tile hides a Rare Candy. Find the next trainer, then go west into a dead end for a Potion.

Go back and continue east, up the stairs, to grab another Potion on the plateau. Back to the second trainer and continue north, past one more trainer, to Striaton City.

-------------
STRIATON CITY
-------------
Fishing (Old Rod): *Basculin.
Fishing (Good Rod): Swanna and *Alomomola.

Basculin has two distinct forms (with red and blue stripe). Both can be caught here.
Swanna is an evolved version, you can catch its base form (Ducklett) later.

The house west from where you come in has a guy who will give you a Great Ball.

A biker in SE corner of the city will give you a Dusk Ball.

The SW corner of the town has X Speed.

Go west to the park, then south past the bridge to find a Great Ball.

East from the town is the Dreamyard. You can catch *Munna and Musharna there. The person on the right will also give you an Eviolite.

The Gym has no normal trainers, just three leaders (and a restaurant, for some reason). You must fight them in a given order: Chili (on the left) first, then Cress (on the right), and finally Cilan (in the middle).

Beating Cilan will give you the Trio Badge and three different TMs: TM109 (Water Pulse), TM38 (Fire Blast), and TM108 (Bullet Seed). The teleport system in Unova will now start to work.

Leave Striaton City through the NW exit and go to Route 3.

-------
ROUTE 3
-------
Wild Pokemon: *Dwebble, *Darumaka, *Trubbish, *Minccino, *Yamask, Scolipede, Darmanitan. Level 8-11.
Fishing (Old Rod): Basculin.
Fishing (Good Rod): Swanna and Alomomola.

First of all, Darmanitan (evolved form of Darumaka) has a special "Zen Mode" alternate form. However, you can't get that yet: you need a Darmanitan with its Hidden Ability for Zen Mode, and Darumakas and Darmanitans here will only have its normal ability. As for Scolipede, that's actually a third-level evolution. Don't worry, you will be able to get its base form, Venipede, pretty soon.

First thing you'll find here is a preschool up the stairs to the north. Fight the two trainers here and grab the two items: a visible Quick Ball and an Ultra Ball that is hidden in the SW corner of this area.

Go back down the stairs and continue west past a pair of double trainers. You'll get to a crossroads where you can go either west or south (there's also a trainer and a Super Potion in the grass patch north of the crossroads). Let's go west first.

Go past a trainer and circle around the trees to the north. You can find a HP Up in the grass there. Then continue west to the cave. A boulder at the south end of the area hides a Great Ball.

Talk to the Snivy at the cave's entrance and it will move away. Go inside.

---------------
WELLSPRING CAVE
---------------
Wild Pokemon: *Roggenrola and Woobat. Level 10-13.
Fishing (Old Rod): Basculin.
Fishing (Good Rod): Swanna and Alomomola.

Go directly west and when you hit the plateau, check the rubble south of you for a Hard Stone. Then continue west and south, up the stairs to the plateau, and east past the trainer until you get a Max Revive at the end of the path. Nothing else here, so go back out.

-------
ROUTE 3
-------

Go east until you get back to the crossroads and continue south. Go past a trainer and then through next two trainers to a fenced grass patch. Snivy will be there and you can fight it and catch it.

Continue south and fight Trip again. Just before the bridge, there is a grass patch with a Repel and a trainer just to the west.

After the bridge, fight another trainer, and then you find the Unova Day Care. The lady here will give you a Scraggy egg; you have to take it before she'll start to perform normal Day Care duties. West from the Day Care is a Full Heal.

Continue west to Nacrene City.

------------
NACRENE CITY
------------

At the west edge of the town, there are two houses with a fance made from bushes. The easternmost bush in the horizontal line hides a Revive.

The SW house has a guy who will trade his Petilil for your Cottonee.

The Poke Center has a Move Tutor for Electroweb.

Iris is in front of the Gym/Museum. Fight her.

In the Museum, you start between two counters. The guy at the right counter revives fossils.
There are many bookshelves (and also three trainers). Check the left side of the top right bookshelf to press a secret switch and uncover a staircase.

Downstairs, you will find Lenora. Fight her. Afterwards, she'll send you to her husband (the left counter at the Museum entrance) who will give you the Cover Fossil (Tirtouga) and the Plume Fossil (Archen). Go back to Lenora and fight her again. When you beat her, she'll give you the Basic Badge and TM05 (Roar). Unova Teleport system gets updated.

Leave the city to the west to reach the Pinwheel Forest.

---------------
PINWHEEL FOREST
---------------
Wild Pokemon: *Sewaddle, *Cottonee, Galvantula, Patrat, *Venipede, Woobat, *Petilil, Pidove. Level 14-17.
Galvantula is an evolved form of Joltik -- you'll be soon able to get one of your own. Venipede is the base form of Scolipede you might have met before.

The main path has 4 trainers on it (two single and a pair of double trainers). Then there's a fenced grass patch with one trainer guarding the path in, two more trainers inside and a Star Piece in a corner.

Continue among the trees to reach second part of the forest. The encounters are different there:

Wild Pokemon: Sewaddle, Woobat, Galvantula, Petilil, Venipede, Patrat, Swadloon, Cottonee, Whirlipede, Gothitelle. Level 14-17.
Fishing (Old Rod): *Tympole.
Fishing (Good Rod): *Ducklett, *Tympole and Alomomola.

Some Pokemon, Petilil in particular, are more common in here. You can also get a Ducklett, base form of Swanna.
There's one new Pokemon, Gothitelle. It's rare and it's an evolved form -- wait a bit, you will be able to get its base form, Gothita, soon.
This is another location where Eevee can evolve into Leafeon.

From the start, go west. You'll meet a pair of double trainers. The path north is blocked for now, so continue west. Fight a trainer, then you'll reach a big grass patch. There's a trainer in this patch, and three items: a Super Potion is visible in the NW corner, but the other two items are hidden:

Super Potion: Start in the NE corner and go west along the fence. Search the first clear tile you come to.
Ether: Start in the SE corner and go west along the fense. Search the second clear tile you come to.

Next, you come to another grass patch with a trainer. North from there is a Great Ball.

Then another big grass patch and another trainer. After that, you'll see a clear area with another trainer. Go down the stairs to the SE.

This grass patch has, once again, a trainer, but also three items. A visible Net Ball is at the end of the path, but you can also find two hidden ones:

TinyMushroom: Find a lone clear tile at the southern edge of this patch. TinyMushroom is hidden two tiles north of it.
Rare Candy: It's hidden in the only lone clear tile at the eastern edge of the patch.

After you get everything, go back up the stairs and continue north. You'll see an event with Burgh. There's a trainer and Star Piece in the area. Continue east to end up on the road. There's another trainer and a SilverPowder south from you. The path to the east is impassable for now, so continue north to the Skyarrow Bridge.

---------------
SKYARROW BRIDGE
---------------

This is just a long, narrow bridge. First guy you come to will give you a Quick Claw.

There's many people on the bridge, but only one of them is a trainer: Cilan. Once you cross the bridge, continue north to Castelia City.

-------------
CASTELIA CITY
-------------

Now that's a lot of Venipedes. You can fight them, but there's no real point since they don't disappear after you defeat them. For now, only one house and the Poke Center are accessible -- all other places are blocked by the Venipedes.

The Poke Center has a guy who will give you a Zoom Lens. The house has another battle with Team Rocket. Once you beat them, the Venipedes will disappear and you will be able to access the rest of the city.

The sailor in the SE corner will give you an evolution stone based on how you answer his question:
Pansage - Leaf Stone
Pansear - Fire Stone
Panpour - Water Stone

You can only do this once, but at this point, you can buy as many of these as you want, so it doesn't really matter what you say.

A little girl on the central street will give you a Destiny Knot.

The guy in the NE corner of the city sells Casteliacones for 100. It's basically a Full Heal, except much cheaper in exchange for only being available at one place.

So that's for the outside of the city, but what's in the buildings?

Poke Ball Factory (SW corner):

The second floor has two vendors selling Poke Balls:
Left vendor:
Level Ball - 300
Lure Ball - 300
Moon Ball - 300
Friend Ball - 300
Love Ball - 300
Heavy Ball - 300
Fast Ball - 300
Repeat Ball - 1000
Timer Ball - 1000

Right vendor:
Nest Ball - 1000
Net Ball - 1000
Dive Ball - 1000
Luxury Ball - 1000
Heal Ball - 300
Quick Ball - 1000
Dusk Ball - 1000

They have the same inventory as the vendors in Slateport MARKET.

The third floor has five trainers in a row. Once you beat them, talk to the guy by the stairs on the right and you'll get a Master Ball.

This is probably your first Master Ball (unless you skipped the red Gyarados or had a ridiculous luck in lottery). Most likely, you'll keep it in your inventory for the rest of the game because there's nothing you really NEED it for. It just saves some time and money in catching Legendary Pokemon, but you don't exactly have a lack of either.

The house north from here, on the right side of the western street, has a Status Judge.

Flower Shop (on the left side of the central street) sells:
Growth Mulch - 200
Damp Mulch - 200
Stable Mulch - 200
Gooey Mulch - 200

Same inventory as in Goldenrod City.

A bit north from the Flower Shop is a house with an old man who will give you a Smoke Ball.

Store (the house on the left side of the eastern street, straight north from the Poke Center):

Second floor sells:
Full Incense - 9600
Lax Incense - 9600
Luck Incense - 9600
Odd Incense - 9600
Pure Incense - 9600
Rock Incense - 9600
Rose Incense - 9600
Sea Incense - 9600
Wave Incense - 9600

Third floor sells:
HP Up - 9800
Protein - 9800
Iron - 9800
Calcium - 9800
Zinc - 9800
Carbos - 9800

Nice, but nothing new.

Studio Castella (the house on the right side of the eastern street) -- nothing important.

The NW house on the eastern street -- a man who will give you TM12 (Taunt).

Now for the Gym. There are four trainers plus Burgh. Beat him for the Insect Badge and TM76 (Struggle Bug). The Unova teleport system gets upgraded again.

Now exit the city to the north, through the park.

-------
ROUTE 4
-------
Wild Pokemon: Roggenrola, *Elgyem, *Litwick, *Blitzle, *Foongus, Darumaka, Lampent, Swoobat, Darmanitan. Level 15-18.
Fishing (Old Rod): Tympole and *Frillish.
Fishing (Good Rod): Palpitoad, *Stunfisk and Beartic.

Beartic is the evolved form of Cubchoo. You can catch one soon.

First of all, go west on the beach. The beach area is big and complex so we'll start by exploring it.

Beat the trainer west from the entrance and two trainers down on the beach. Continue north into the weird maze of fences. This area has three trainers, two visible items (an X Accuracy and a Great Ball) and one hidden item. At the western edge of this area is a 2x4 rectangle of grass. An Ether is hidden in the NW tile.

Now go all the way back to the start of the route and go north. Beat three trainers along the route, and then you run into that jerk Trip again. DECIMATE HIM.

Now you'll reach a crossroad. The way north is blocked, so you'll have to go west. This path has three trainers, a visible Hyper Potion, and a hidden Ether. It's hidden in the middle of the three boulders in this area.

Eventually, you'll get to a new area of Route 4 with new set of Pokemon:

Wild Pokemon: *Emolga, *Cubchoo, *Joltik, *Audino, Scrafty, Mandibuzz, *Larvesta, Simisear, Scolipede. Level 15-18.

Cubchoo is the base form of Beartic.
Joltik is the base form of Galvantula you have probably met before.
Scrafty is the evolved form of Scraggy, but you should already get one from the egg the Day Care lady gave you.
Mandibuzz is the evolved form of Vullaby. It will take some time before you can catch a Vullaby, so if you want to breed a Mandibuzz, that's also an option.
Finally, Simisear is the evolved form of Pansear. You'll be able to catch a Pansear soon.

Enter the house (Club Battle). You need to fight four trainers. Afterwards, grab the item at the end of the road, which is a set of wings: Health Wing, Muscle Wing, Resist Wing, Genius Wing, Clever Wing, Swift Wing, and Pretty Wing.

Now go back to the crossroads and north to reach Nimbasa City.

------------
NIMBASA CITY
------------

Start by going to the house west from the Poke Center. The boy upstairs will give you a Sun Stone.

The house north of the Poke Center has two ladies inside. The right one will give you another Soothe Bell. The left one will judge the EVs of your lead Pokemon and give it the Effort Ribbon if it's maxed.

The north part of the city has three buildings. The left and middle ones are stadiums where you can fight some trainers - 6 trainers at the Small Court (left) and 9 trainers at the Big Stadium (right).

The right building is the Music Hall. Talk to the old man (top right person) and answer "Yes" to his question to get TM61 (Will-O-Wisp)	.

Now let's go to the gym. Pick X Attack along the way, in the eastern part of the city. The Gym has 4 trainers plus Elesa. Beat her for the Bolt Badge and TM72 (Volt Switch).

Unova teleport system gets updated again. Also, the Battle Subway is open to you now. Once you get there, you'll meet Cilan again. Fight the Subway Bosses, Emmett and Ingo.

Now go all the way back to Fuchsia City in Kanto. We have the next part of Safari Zone to tackle! Go through the SW exit to reach the Unova part.

-----------------
SAFARI ZONE UNOVA
-----------------
Wild Pokemon: *Pansage, *Pansear, Audino, *Axew, *Durant, Ferrothorn, *Heatmor, Larvesta, Dwebble, *Deino, Gothorita, Deerling. Level 30-35.
Fishing (Old Rod): *Panpour and Alomomola.
Fishing (Good Rod): *Cryogonal, Stunfisk and Cubchoo.

Ferrothorn is the evolved form of Ferroseed. It will still be some time before you can catch your own.
Gothorita is the evolved form of Gothita. You'll be able to catch it soon.

There are two visible items here (a Dusk Stone and a Protein), and one hidden item: a Nugget. It's in the 4x4 square patch of grass, 2nd tile from north and 2nd from east.

Once you're done here, return to Nimbasa City and leave through the west exit to Route 5.

-------
ROUTE 5
-------
Wild Pokemon: *Lillipup, Deino, Sawsbuck, *Boufallant, Axew, Pansage, Pansear, Panpour, *Gothita, Gigalith, Garbodor. Level 19-22.

...Or you could just catch the majority of Safari Zone Pokemon here. Your choice. And we can finally find the base Gothita.

This Route is divided in two parts: the northern part with grass patches, and the southern road. The northern part has three trainers and three visible items: from east to west, they are a Revive, a Zinc and a Great Ball. The southern part has 7 trainers and a vendor who sells berries out of a truck. Probably ilegally harvested, I'd wager.

When you get to the bridge, talk to the guy there. If you have finished both the Nimbasa Gym AND the Battle Subway, he'll let you cross. Continue west and talk to another bridge attendant to get to Driftveil City.

BTW, you can fish from the bridge, though the only Pokemon you can catch there with either rod is Ducklett.

--------------
DRIFTVEIL CITY
--------------

The first house you come to has three move tutors, teaching Fire Pledge, Water Pledge and Grass Pledge.

The girl next to the Market will give you a Big Pearl. The Market has three vendors: the left one sells Moo Moo Milk, the middle one sells bitter medicine and the third one sells Incenses.

West from the Market is a trainer.

Go east to a fenced area at the edge of the town. Talk to the girl here to get a Rocky Helmet.

Enter the house west from the Poke Center and talk to the old man there to get a Shell Bell.

The Poke Center has a trader who will trade his Zorua for your Minccino. You should do that, since there's no other way to get a Zorua.

Finally, talk to Clay in front of the Gym. He doesn't want to fight -- bummer. Go to the southern part of the city and talk to the sailor. He wouldn't help you before but now he'll take you to the Milos Island.

------------
MILOS ISLAND
------------
Weather forecast: Stormy.
Wild Pokemon: Patrat, Pidove, Blitzle, Cottonee, Deerling, Darmanitan, Sawsbuck. Level 20-23.
Fishing (Old Rod): Basculin and Swanna.
Fishing (Good Rod): Swanna, Alomomola and Basculin.

This island is one long, winding road with lots of trainers -- and there are also the three legendary Forces of Nature for you to capture (all three are fast, so Fast Balls are preferred). The sequence is 2 trainers - Tornadus - 4 trainers - Thundurus - 2 trainers - Landorus. Once you fight Landorus, you'll be transported back to Driftveil City. You can still take the boat back, but the trainers will be gone now and the weather will calm down -- the only reason to come back is to fight wild Pokemon or fish.

Back in Driftveil City, fight Chili who now blocks the way to the Gym, and finally get inside. The gym has also a single winding road with stairs. There are 5 trainers and Clay at the end. Beat Clay for the Quake Badge and TM28 (Dig).

Unova Teleport system gets updated again.

Leave Driftveil City to the west and go to Route 6.

-------
ROUTE 6
-------
Wild Pokemon: *Shelmet, *Karrablast, Bouffalant, Deerling, Joltik, Tranquill, Foongus, *Sigilyph, Escavalier, Accelgor. Level 22-25.
Fishing (Old Rod): Panpour and Tympole.
Fishing (Good Rod): Tympole, Panpour and Palpitoad.

Note that in order to evolve Shelmet and Karrablast, you must level them up when you have both in your party. Try to make them both level up in the same battle -- if you only evolve Shelmet, for example, you will need to get another Shelmet in order to evolve Karrablast.

Start by going west past a bridge. Fight a trainer in the first grass patch. The western edge of this patch has two clear spots, check the second tile from the north in the northern spot for a Big Mushroom.

Continue east past another bridge. Fight a trainer and talk to the next guy to receive a Silk Scarf. Continue west past yet ANOTHER bridge (seriously, did someone get a contract to build as many bridges as possible with no regards to practicality?), fight a trainer and enter the house. One guy there will give you a Leaf Stone if you show him a Deerling.

Go west past another trainer, and then you can grab two items: an Elixir in the grass to the south and a Hyper Potion -- that one requires to go around the fence to the north.

Continue west through a big grass patch with a trainer. (Bridge count 4). The next grass patch (Bridge count 5) has two trainers and there's a house to the east. An old man there will heal your party.

Go up the stairs and you'll be in front of the Chargestone Cave. If you come here before beating Clay, the entrance will be blocked, but now it's being guarded by a Krokorok. Defeat it, then pick up BlackGlasses it drops.

Before going to the cave, there's one more grass patch to the SE. It has a girl who will give you a Shiny Stone, and a trainer in the dead end.

Now enter the cave.

----------------
CHARGESTONE CAVE
----------------
Wild Pokemon: This cave has three floors. All floors contain Joltik, *Klink, Klang, Galvantula and Klinklang, but each of them also has one Pokemon that only appears there. The unique Pokemon on 1F is *Druddigon, on B1F it's Sigilyph and on B2F it's Cofagrigus.

All three floors of the cave allow the evolution of Magneton and Nosepass.

Start by going north. Turn west when you can to grab a Full Heal.

Continue north. You'll get to a crossroads. Go east to a small area with a trainer and a Revive.

Go back to the crossroads and continue north. Fight a trainer and continue east. On the next crossroads, grab a Heal Ball to the north, then return and take the stairs to the south.

Go east. You'll see a small corner south of you, there is a Max Potion hidden on the tile.

Continue south and east past the bridge. The next area contains a visible Hyper Potion and a trainer. Go south and west to reach a dead end with an Iron. Take the ladder down.

On B1F, start by going west. Go past a trainer and fight two more trainers who guard the stairs to the north. But don't go there yet -- go west first.

Hug the northern wall and go west until you hit a corner -- a Full Heal is hidden in that corner. Continue north to grab a visible Thunderstone, then west to a ladder back to 1F. You'll appear in a small area with a healer, a trainer, and an item (a Magnet). Be careful to not accidentally jump down to the west!

Go back down the ladder and return to the crossroad. Take the stairs to the north. Go east and north to get a Timer Ball, then back and north for a trainer.

The northern passageway leads you to two more trainers, and then to two ladders: one up, one down. The exit is past the up ladder, but let's go down first.

On B2F, go south past a trainer. Eventually, you'll arrive to a crossroad where you can continue east or south.

The eastern branch ends with a room that contains two visible items: a Lucky Egg and a Brightpowder. But that's not all -- there's also a Full Heal hidden on the tile between them.

The southern branch has another trainer and TM57 (Charge Beam). Continue east and turn north to reach a dead end. The two tiles in this dead end contain a Rare Candy and a Star Piece.

That's it for B2F, so return to the ladder, then take the other ladder up. Back on 1F go east, then south and search the rock pile there for an Elixir. Go east to reach a crossroad and take the southern path to fight a trainer. Continue south until you reach the dead end -- the middle tile in here contains a hidden HP Up.

Return to the crossroad and take the eastern path. Go up the stairs and fight Iris. Exit to the Mistralton City.

---------------
MISTRALTON CITY
---------------

The house north of the Poke Center has a Move Relearner and a Move Deleter. The guy in the house west from that will give you a Sharp Beak.

Talk to Cilan in front of the Gym and fight him. This makes Skyla go back inside. Enter the Gym -- it has five normal trainers plus Skyla. Beat her for the Jet Badge and TM62 (Acrobatics). Teleport system in Unova gets updated again. Leave the town through the NE exit to Route 7.

-------
ROUTE 7
-------
Wild Pokemon: Durant, Sewaddle, *Purrloin, Watchog, Litwick, Lampent, Blitzle, Volcarona, Chandelure. Level 26-29.

Once again, we have a big and complex route, so let's get to it.

Right at the beginning, there are two paths: through the plateau with two trainers, or through the grass patch with two... items? Oh, wait, only the NE Pokeball icon is an item (a HP Up). The SW icon is a battle with wild Foongus. Well, its Pokedex entry DOES mention it looks similar to a Poke Ball...

Next on our Route tour is a house. The man inside will trade your Emolga for his Boldore.

Continue east and north past three trainers. At the west side of this area are two items, a Max Ether and a Zinc.

Next is a tower. Enter it.

----------------
MISTRALTON TOWER
----------------
Wild Pokemon: The tower has five floors (1-4F and roof). Wild Pokemon only appear on floor 2-4 and the selection wildly differs.
2F: Litwick and Purrloin
3F: *Solosis, Elgyem and Litwick
4F: *Golett, Litwick, Solosis and Elgyem.

Levels are 26-29 for all three floors.

1F: Nothing special, continue to 2F.
2F: Three trainers, nothing else.
3F: Five trainers. There's a Hyper Potion in the NE part of the floor.
4F: Three trainers and four items! All items are visible, they are: a Revive, a PP Up, a Spell Tag, and a HP Up.
Roof: There's a guy who will reward you with TM66 (Payback).

Back on Route 7, there's an item east from the road leading to the Mistralton Tower... nah, it's another Foongus. Another path east from the road leads through the grass to a trainer and another house.

Continue east to a plateau with two trainers. You can continue to the end and then go down to the west, or you can go down the stairs to south. Do that first. There's a PP Up, and then you get into a separated part of Route 7 with the Clubsplosion building.

The wild Pokemon here are very different. People here will mention a tradition of using Fighting types, and it can be seen in the grass: *Sawk, *Throh, Scraggy, Gurdurr, Mienshao, *Timburr, *Mienfoo, Conkeldurr. Level 27-31.

The building itself has a PC (don't forget that storing a Pokemon in the PC, even just for a second, will fully heal it). Talk to the attendant to get taken into a room where you must beat three trainers to grab the prize at the end. The prize is a set of Vitamins: HP Up, Protein, Iron, Calcium, Zinc, Carbos and PP Max.

Return to the plateau and leave it through the eastern section. Two more trainers on this path. If you've done Clubsplosion, you can enter the cave.

--------------
TWIST MOUNTAIN
--------------
Wild Pokemon: *Drilbur, Boldore, Gurdurr, Woobat, Cubchoo, Heatmor, Excadrill, Gigalith, Conkeldurr, Swoobat, Beartic, Volcarona.

This is a pretty complicated area, so make sure to follow my directions exactly. Right now you can access three floors (1F-3F), plus an outdoor area. All cave areas share the same wild Pokemon list.

3F: Go north and east. Exit the cave.

Outdoors: Go north. Fight a trainer and grab the TM77 (Psych Up) in the dead end. Go back south, past the entrance, and continue east past another trainer until you see another cave entrance. Take it.

3F: Go south and east past the trainer. Continue east and turn north when you can. Grab an Elixir and exit the cave.

Outdoors: Fight a trainer and grab a Dusk Stone in the dead end. Go back inside.

3F: Go south, east and north past a trainer. Check the boulder in the NE corner for a Rare Candy. Exit to the west.

Outdoors: Go north past a trainer and enter the cave.

3F: Go east, fight a trainer, then go east and check the boulder at the northern wall for a Hyper Potion. Go south, down the stairs, and exit the cave.

2F: Go south and grab a Protein. Go west and exit the cave.

Outdoors: Go west along the path. Grab a Full Heal, then fight a trainer. Enter the cave after that.

2F: Go west and take the second path north. When you get to a group of boulders, check the only rock pile among them for a Revive. Continue north and grab a Metal Coat to the west. Go east and exit the cave.

Outdoors: There is a healer north from you. Go north. You'll get to a trainer and an Ultra Ball. There will be two cave entrances here, take the eastern one.

2F: Go north and east and fight a trainer. Continue east and grab an Ether. Go back west, then south and east. Exit the cave to the south.

Outdoors: Grab an Iron on this small platform and go back inside.

2F: Go north and enter the cave.

3F: Go north and grab a PP Up.
Do NOT take the western exit here, there is no point. Instead, go back south to 2F, then south-west-north-west-south through that area to end up in the area with two entrances. Now take the western one.

2F: Go north and east and check the second boulder you come to for a Stardust. Go back west, then north and enter the cave.

1F: Another Team Rocket encounter. Go west past, down the stairs, then continue west and go up another stairs. A boulder here hides a Full Heal.
Go back east and take the path south. The first boulder (at the eastern wall) has a Stardust. Go south and west and grab a Revive. Fight a trainer and exit the cave.

Outdoors: Now you are in the central area of the mountain. Go south and east and grab a Moon Stone. Go east, down the stairs to the south, and then down the stairs to the west to grab a Max Potion. You can't enter the cave here yet, but note the spot.
Return east and north. Go up the stairs to the east. The area south of you is where you'd end up if you took the exit I told you not to take. There's a bunch of boulders blocking your way. Check the SW one for a Stardust.
Go back down the stairs and north into a cave.

1F: Go north and take the path west to grab a Nugget. Return and continue north. The boulder adjacent to the north wall hides an Ultra Ball.
Go a bit south, then east. Fight a trainer and exit east, to Icirrus City.

------------
ICIRRUS CITY
------------
Weather forecast: Sometimes rainy

First of all, go right to the big puddle. There's a Max Revive hidden in there. To find it, line yourself under the door to the house to the north, go two tile into the puddle and check the tile to your east.

Climb the stairs east from that house and cross the bridge to the east. Grab a PP Up there.

Go west to the Poke Center and talk to the girl on the left to get a Black Belt.

Enter the cave at the western edge of the town. Kyurem is there -- I presume you know what to do. Kyurem weighs a lot, so Heavy Balls are preferred.

East from the cave is Pokemon Fan Club. Talk to the old man and answer "Yes" to his question to get another Exp. Share.

Enter the house NE from there and talk to the girl to get a RageCandyBar. Go west from there and enter the Gym.

The Gym has 6 normal trainers plus Brycen. Beat him for the Freeze Badge and TM79 (Frost Breath). Unova Teleport system gets updated again. Now go to the Pokemon Fan Club and talk to the woman next to the old man. She'll give you a Cleanse Tag.

Now leave the city through the north path and go to Route 8.

-------
ROUTE 8
-------
Weather forecast: Sometimes rainy
Fishing (Old Rod): Frillish and *Tynamo.
Fishing (Good Rod): Swanna and *Tynamo.

This is an open Route without any random encounters. There are 5 trainers in total, and 5 items: visible Poison Barb, Ultra Ball and 2 Full Restores, and a Max Elixir hidden in a boulder NE from the sailor.

At this point, you can talk to the sailor and go to Virbank City. But before we do that, let's continue east to Route 9.

-------
ROUTE 9
-------
Wild Pokemon: *Ferroseed, Tynamo, Gothita, Cottonee, Whimsicott, Zebstrika, Krokorok. Level 30-33.

Another fairly open road divided in safe northern part and grassy southern part.
There's 7 trainers in total, all in the northern part (two guard the entrance to the southern part). Each part also has one visible and one hidden item.

In the northern part, the visible item is a Full Restore. To get the hidden item, some searching is needed. Find an L-shaped group of trees in the western part of the Route. Stand east from the easternmost tree there, walk three tiles south and check the tile to the east for a Lemonade.

The visible item in the southern part (way west from where you enter this part) is a HP Up. To find the hidden item (a Max Ether), go to the middle of the three big grass patches there. Its northern edge has three connected grass tiles and one single one. Go to the middle of the three and search the tile south of you.

The path to the east is impassable for now, but you can enter the big building which is a... Shopping Mall? Sure, why not.

We've seen enough of these by now, so just quick notes: 2F has some basic Poke Mart items (healing/Poke Balls) 3F has a Move Tutor (Last Resort). 4F sells evolution stones (all except for Ice Stone) and 5F sells Vitamins and X- items. There's also a guy on 5F who will give you a Thunderstone.

That's all for now. Return to the sailor on Route 8 and sail to Virbank City.

------------
VIRBANK CITY
------------
Fishing (Old Rod): Frillish.
Fishing (Good Rod): Jellicent, Swanna and Alomomola.

House next to a Gym has a guy who will trade your Koffing for his Gurdurr.

Go north. Next to the Poke Center is a group of vases. The one in the center has a Full Heal in it.

And there's also Meloetta. Talk to it and it will come with you.

With Meloetta in tow, you can enter the Gym. The Gym has just two trainers and Roxie. Beat Roxie for the Toxic Badge and TM34 (Sludge Wave).

When you leave the Gym, you'll meet Cynthia who invites you to Undella Town. Unova teleport system gets updated. Which is a good thing since we have just gotten our 8th Unova Badge and that means we have unlocked some more stuff!

At this point, you can go and fight the Musketeers - Cobalion, Terrakion and Virizion.

Cobalion: Go to Driftveil City and leave to the west to Route 6. Go past first three bridges (sigh...) and then north and east past yet another bridge to a cave. Cobalion will be there.

Terrakion: Go to Icirrus City and enter Twist Mountain again. Pass through the first passage and you'll be in the central area again. Go south, and then west, to the cave that was blocked by rocks. You'll end up in Twist Mountain 4F; this area has a Glacial Rock so you can evolve Eevee into Glaceon there. It has normal random encounters and Terrakion is here.

Virizion: Go to Nacrene City and leave to the west to the Pinwheel Forest. Continue to the second area and go north along the road. Turn east. Grab a Big Root in the grass patch and continue east and north into the trees. You'll get to a glade where Virizion is.

Cobalion and Terrakion are heavy so Heavy Balls are preferable. Virizion is not heavy enough, but it's fast, so use Fast Balls for it.

When you're done, go to Nimbasa City. You can now leave through the NE exit.

--------
ROUTE 16
--------
Wild Pokemon: Rattata, Foongus, Pidove, Onix, Magnemite, Blitzle, Gothita, Hydreigon. Level 31-35.

This is a short Route which is, once again, divided into the "road" part (south) with trainers and a grassy part (north).

The southern part has three trainers and one item (a HP Up). The Biker here is not a trainer -- he will give you a Charcoal instead.

The northern part has two trainers and two items (a Heal Ball and a Rare Candy).

In the eastern part, where both paths merge, is one final trainer.

After you go through this Route, you'll exit to Undella Town.

------------
UNDELLA TOWN
------------
Fishing (Old Rod): Staryu and Krabby.
Fishing (Good Rod): Wailord, Beartic and Dragonite.

There are three houses in the northern part of the town. The middle house has Leftovers while the right house has a guy who will trade his Munchlax for your Cinccino. It's a chance to get Munchlax/Snorlax if you didn't catch the one on Orange Islands.

Go to the NW corner of the town. Before entering Cynthia's Villa, stand east to the sign and go one tile east, two tiles north and check the bush east of you for a Big Nugget. Now enter the villa -- this will update Unova teleport system. Go north, west and north into a room where you can fight Dawn. There's also an old man who functions as a healer.

Once you beat Dawn, you can go to the Junior Cup in the SE corner of the town. You need to fight four battles there: two normal trainers, Iris and Trip. Talk to Alder at the end -- he'll give you TM87 (Swagger).

Once you get out, you'll see that Team Rocket has overrun the town. They block all exits and even the Poke Center teleport. (If you need to use the PC, there's one in the Junior Cup building). A new path opens east from the Junior Cup building; go through it to reach Undella Bay.

In the Bay, beat the seven Team Rocket trainers on the lower level. When you get up the stairs, you'll be thrown into another Jesse/James battle.

After beating them, continue north towards Giovanni and fight him. After the battle, you'll be transported back into town and the Bay won't be accessible anymore.

Meloetta is now blocking the northern exit from the town. Talk to it and take it with you. Go through the exit.

(At this point, the blocked eastern exit on Route 9 will open as well. However, both Route 9 and Route 12 lead to the same place, Opelucid City.)

--------
ROUTE 12
--------
Wild Pokemon: *Rufflet, *Vullaby, Amoonguss, Karrablast, Corphish, Buizel, Zweilous, Fraxure, Axew. Level 33-36.

This is another fairly open Route that includes 4 normal trainers and one pair of double trainers. There are three items here, all visible: a Full Heal, a Max Repel, and a Max Revive.

When you're done here, exit west to Opelucid City.

-------------
OPELUCID CITY
-------------

Go south from Poke Center and down the stairs. There are two bushes to the east. Check the southern one for a Max Repel.
Enter the house north of the Poke Center and talk to the guy there to get a Cell Battery.
Enter the house next to the Gym and talk to the guy there to get a Ring Target.
Enter the house next to the previous one and talk to the guy there to get a Float Stone.
Go to the NE corner of the city. Fight Iris. You'll get TM82 (Dragon Tail). Unova Teleport system gets updated.
Leave through the NE exit to Vetress City.

------------
VETRESS CITY
------------
Wild Pokemon: Stoutland, Swoobat, Eevee, Trubbish, Mareep, Zebstrika, Blitzle, Cryogonal, Garbodor, Bouffalant. Level 35-39.

There are three shops in the area: Incenses, Drinks and Berries.

You've seen several Leagues by now, so you know how they work. Register, then start with the far left exit and move to the right after every win. You'll have to fight in five battles.

After you're done, go out. Cilan appears and fights you. When you win, he will give you the Super Rod!

So, what's Super Rod for? In the locations you've seen so far, it won't actually help you all that much; usually, you'll be able to catch the same Pokemon you can get with Old Rod or Good Rod, except that they will be 10 levels higher.

Generally, if you're trying to catch a particular Pokemon, the Super Rod will improve your chances ONLY if you want to catch the "rarer" Pokemon with Old Rod. The most important example is probably Route 121 in Hoenn where Super Rod gives you a better chance to get a Luvdisc for potential Heart Scale farming.
In all other situations, however, a specific Pokemon is easier to catch with one of the other Rods.

The only exception from this general rule is Pallet Town, where you can get Horsea and Staryu with Super Rod, but none of the others.

Go to Nuvema Town and talk to Professor Juniper to start the N arc. Note that Vetress City will permanently close once you do that so if you want to do any shopping/leveling there, do it before.

After talking to Professor Juniper, go to Virbank City and take the newly opened western exit to Route 20.

--------
ROUTE 20
--------
Wild Pokemon: *Maractus, *Pawniard, Minccino, Sunflora, Shinx, Amoonguss. Level 36-40.
Fishing (Old Rod): Ducklett.
Fishing (Good Rod): Alomomola, Beartic and Swanna.
Fishing (Super Rod): Seel, Ducklett, Beartic and Swanna.

Right from the start, there's another Team Rocket battle.

Go down the stairs, fight a trainer on the ledge, go down another stairs, fight another trainer.
Go down the stairs, go south and grab a Full Heal.
Go west and north along the path, fight a trainer.
Go up the stairs. Continue north into the trees. There's Keldeo here -- catch it (Fast Balls are preferable).
Go back out. Go south into a grass patch; fight a trainer and grab a Sticky Barb there. Cross one of the bridges west; this area has two trainers and two items (a Rare Candy and a Heart Scale).

Continue west to Route 19:

--------
ROUTE 19
--------
Wild Pokemon: Braviary, Swadloon, Maractus, Scolipede, Audino, Galvantula. Level 36-40.
Fishing (Old Rod): Ducklett.
Fishing (Good Rod): Alomomola, Beartic and Swanna.
Fishing (Super Rod): Ducklett, Alomomola, Beartic and Swanna.

From the start, go west and north. You can fight and catch Genesect here. Genesect is neither heavy nor fast, so Timer Balls are the way to go.

Then go back and continue west along the Route. There are three trainers and one item (an Expert Belt) on the way, all quite easy to see.

Exit south to Aspertia City.

-------------
ASPERTIA CITY
-------------

Nothing much here -- go to the Gym and fight Cheren. He will give you TM49 (Echoed Voice).

After the battle, the path west opens. Go to "White Ruins". Beat Colress of Team Plasma (this will update the Unova Teleport system for the last time), and then you can fight Reshiram and capture it. Reshiram is heavy, so use Heavy Balls.

Now go to Castelia City and exit north to Route 4. Go into the desert and make your way to the NE corner of this area. Victini will be there, our last Gen 5 Legendary! Fast Balls are recommended.

And that's it for Unova! Go talk to Oak and then it's back to Viridian City. Take the blimp to its new destination, Lumiose City!
